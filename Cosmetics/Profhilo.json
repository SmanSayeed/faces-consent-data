                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the possible benefits and risks associated with Profhilo treatment. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions you have fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before making an informed choice. It is important you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any point during the process.\n\nProfhilo is a skin bioremodelling treatment composed of a high concentration of hyaluronic acid. It functions by stimulating the skin's natural production of collagen and elastin while also enhancing hydration. Profhilo is delivered through a series of small intradermal injections using fine needles and aims to revitalize, firm, moisturize, and lift the skin. It is used to address tired, aging, loose, and dehydrated skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles. While commonly applied to the face for rejuvenation, it can also be used on the neck and hands. Profhilo is not intended for deep lines, scars, or adding volume; it is not a dermal filler and will not produce the same outcomes. A topical numbing cream is typically offered before injection to help minimize discomfort.\n\nProfhilo treatment involves two sessions scheduled four weeks apart. To maintain results, a subsequent two-session course is recommended every six months. After the initial treatment, results typically develop gradually over 4 to 6 weeks. Effects generally last around six months on average but can vary in duration. I understand that results differ between individuals and depend on many personal factors. I am aware there is no guarantee I will achieve my desired outcome and that more than one treatment course may be needed to attain or sustain results.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for optimal results. I will be informed before each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, Profhilo carries potential risks and complications. You must be aware of the following possibilities before proceeding and discuss any concerns fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon reactions include pain, bleeding, and bruising at the injection site. The area may feel tender afterwards but should not be severely painful. If you experience significant pain following treatment, you must contact your practitioner promptly for assessment. Bruising severity varies; it is often mild but can occasionally be more pronounced. Bruising may take up to two weeks to fully fade but should improve noticeably within a week. In rare cases, significant bruising can lead to a hematoma (a collection of clotted blood), which may take at least two weeks to resolve naturally; your practitioner will provide appropriate aftercare guidance. Redness and swelling are common and usually mild, improving within a few days but potentially lasting up to 14 days in some instances.\n\nLess common complications include skin infection (cellulitis), presenting as hot, red, shiny skin and possibly general malaise. If you suspect an infection, you should contact your practitioner and seek medical assessment promptly, as antibiotics may be needed. Occasionally, an infection may form an abscess, requiring urgent medical attention. If you are prone to cold sores (herpes simplex), injections can sometimes trigger a reactivation. Occasionally, an unwanted inflammatory response to Profhilo can lead to delayed nodule formation called granulomas, which may appear months later. Several treatment options exist for granulomas, and you may need medical evaluation. Some individuals may feel faint during or after injections; you must inform your practitioner immediately if you feel unwell.\n\nRare complications include an allergic reaction to Profhilo, including a severe anaphylactic reaction requiring emergency medical care and hospital transfer. Very rarely, Profhilo can be inadvertently injected into a blood vessel, causing a blockage (vascular occlusion). If untreated, this can lead to tissue death (necrosis), potentially requiring reconstructive surgery. In such a rare event, it would be treated emergently with injections of Hyaluronidase, an enzyme that dissolves the hyaluronic acid and can usually reverse the occlusion without lasting harm. Your practitioner is trained to use Hyaluronidase in an emergency; however, if unsuccessful, you would require urgent medical or specialist aesthetic doctor assessment.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and fully understand it. This advice includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking treatment and desired outcome\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of refusing the procedure\n- Any risks specific to me\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their pros and cons, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of success\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I require to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent, understand it fully, have had ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information.\n\nAll deposits and booking fees are non-refundable unless otherwise agreed with the practitioner."
