                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks associated with brow lamination. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, evaluating all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is important you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nBrow lamination is essentially a perming process for eyebrow hairs. It involves a two-step chemical treatment where a solution relaxes the bonds in the hairs to straighten them, followed by a setting solution that shapes and often lifts the hairs into a fixed position. Lamination aims to create a more desirable shape and fuller appearance for the eyebrows. Results typically last 6 to 8 weeks, though duration can vary.\n\nBrow lamination is generally painless and serves as an alternative to microblading. It is considered a low-risk procedure with few complications; however, as with any treatment, some risks exist. Brow lamination can occasionally cause dryness and damage to the eyebrow hairs, and in rare cases, hair loss. This risk is higher if treatments are repeated too frequently or at intervals shorter than 6 weeks.\n\nRarely, eye irritation or infection could occur if any of the chemical products come into contact with the eyes. In extremely rare instances, severe injury could lead to corneal scarring and potential vision loss. Should you experience any eye infection or injury, you should seek urgent medical attention. It is crucial to keep your eyes closed throughout the treatment to protect them from accidental product contact. As with any chemical applied to the skin, there is a risk of allergic reaction. In exceedingly rare circumstances, a severe anaphylactic reaction could occur, requiring emergency medical care.\n\nA patch test should be performed at least 48 hours before each brow lamination treatment. A separate patch test is also necessary if a brow tint is to be done concurrently. The purpose of the patch test is to identify individuals who may have a severe allergic reaction to the product.\n\nThe technician and the business performing this service will not be held responsible for any damages to me or my eyebrows resulting from any cause, including allergic reactions, reactions to previous treatments (such as henna or tint), skin sensitivity, or my failure to adhere to aftercare instructions.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and fully understand it. This advice includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking treatment and desired outcome\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of refusing the procedure\n- Any risks specific to me\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their pros and cons, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of success\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I require to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent, understand it fully, have had ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
