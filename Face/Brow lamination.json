                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT CONSENT: This is an informed consent form that has been prepared to help inform you of the potential benefits and risks of brow lamination. It is important that you read this information carefully and discuss fully with your practitioner before proceeding with treatment. \n\nIt is also important that you take as much time as you need to consider the treatment carefully, weighing up all your options before reaching an informed decision.  It is essential that you are aware of your right to have a second opinion and you are encouraged to ask any questions that come to mind throughout the entirety of the process.\n\nBrow lamination in simple terms is like a perm for your eyebrows. It is a two-step process by which a chemical solution is used to relax bonds between the hairs and straighten them, then a setting lotion is used to shape and often lift the eyebrow hairs into a set position. Lamination acts to give the eyebrows a more aesthetically desirable shape and appearance. Results usually last up to 6-8 weeks but they can last for longer or shorter time periods. \n\nBrow lamination is painless and is a great alternative to microblading. Brow lamination is a low-risk procedure with few complications however as with any treatment some risks are possible.  Brow lamination can occasionally cause dryness and damage to the eyebrow hairs and rarely loss of hairs. This is more likely to happen if the procedure is repeated too often or sooner than 6-week intervals. \n\nRarely eye irritation or infection could occur if any of the lamination chemicals come into contact with the eyes. If severe injury occurs, then corneal scarring could lead to blindness in extremely rare cases. If you sustain an eye infection or injury then you should seek urgent medical attention. It is important to keep your eyes closed during the treatment to protect them from any accidental contact with products used. As with any chemical used on the skin there is a risk of allergic reaction. In extremely rare circumstances you could develop an anaphylactic reaction which would require emergency medical care. \n\nA patch test should be done 48 hours before each brow lamination. Also, a separate patch test should be conducted if you are having a brow tint at the same time. The patch test is deigned to predict those who might develop a severe allergic reaction to the product.\n\nThe technician and the business performing the service on me will not be liable for any damages caused to me or my eyebrows in any way caused by any reason including allergic reaction, reaction to previous procedure such as henna/tint in the brow hair, skin sensitivity and my failure to follow the aftercare instructions.\n\nI have been advised of the relevant information associated with this treatment and I confirm that I fully understand this advice.  This includes advice about:\n\n- the aims/motivations for having the procedure and the desired outcome\n- the risks inherent in the procedure\n- the risks inherent in refusing the procedure\n- the risks specific to me\n- the expected benefits of the treatment\n- the potential disadvantages of the treatment\n- alternative procedures and their pros and cons - including the option of no treatment at all\n- any uncertainties about and the likelihood of success of the procedure\n- any follow-up treatment that may be required\n\nCLINICAL PHOTOS AND VIDEOS: I agree to and authorise the taking of clinical photographs and videos.  I understand that these clinical photographs and videos will form part of and will be kept with my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I want and would need in order to make an informed decision.  I have been given the opportunity to discuss my desired outcome fully in order for me to make an informed decision.\n\n\nI certify that I have read the above consent and that I fully understand it. I have been given ample opportunity for discussion and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has become available that affects my decision to have the treatment or my decision to consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This constitutes the full disclosure and supersedes any previous verbal or written disclosures."
