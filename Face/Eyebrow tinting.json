                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form aims to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of eyebrow tinting. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your provider before proceeding.\n\nYou should allocate sufficient time to consider this service thoroughly, evaluating all your alternatives before making an informed decision. It is essential that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that occur to you at any stage of the process.\n\nEyebrow tinting is a semi-permanent cosmetic procedure that uses vegetable-based dye to enhance, darken, and define eyebrow hairs, making them appear fuller, better shaped, and more visible without the need for daily makeup for 3-6 weeks. It is suitable for all skin types and delivers a natural, smudge-resistant appearance that holds up against water, sweat, and oil.\n\nThe session lasts 15-45 minutes, involving cleansing, shaping, dye application for 5-20 minutes depending on desired intensity, removal, and setting with oil or serum. A patch test 24-48 hours in advance is standard to check for allergic reactions. Results fade gradually; maintenance sessions keep the look consistent. Due to factors such as skin type, hair porosity, lifestyle, and overall health, you acknowledge that there are no guarantees, warranties, or promises of satisfaction with your outcome.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for best results. I will be informed ahead of each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, there are risks and potential complications. It is important that you are aware of these before proceeding. I am aware of the following potential risks/complications:\n\nCommon side effects include temporary redness, mild stinging or irritation around the eyebrows, slight swelling, or uneven fading, which typically subside within 24-48 hours.\n\nRare complications include allergic reactions to dye ingredients like PPD causing intense itching, swelling, or blisters; eye irritation or infection if dye comes into contact with the eyes; skin burns or sensitivity with frequent use; or hyperpigmentation. Not recommended for pregnant individuals, active eye or skin infections, known allergies to dyes, or recent eye surgery; a patch test is mandatory.\n\nI understand that the treatment may involve risks of complication or injury from both known and unknown causes, and I voluntarily accept those risks. Before receiving the service, I have been open in disclosing any condition that could affect this procedure.\n\nI confirm I have been provided with all relevant information regarding this service and fully comprehend it. This information includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking the service and the desired outcome\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form, understand it completely, have been given ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo the service or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete and final disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
