                        "consentFormName": "Lash Lift",
                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT CONSENT: This is an informed consent form that has been prepared to help inform you of the potential benefits and risks of lash lift procedure. It is important that you read this information carefully and discuss fully with your practitioner before proceeding with treatment. \n\nIt is also important that you take as much time as you need to consider the treatment carefully, weighing up all your options before reaching an informed decision.  It is essential that you are aware of your right to have a second opinion and you are encouraged to ask any questions that come to mind throughout the entirety of the process.\n\n\nA lash lift is a procedure to give you eyelashes a desirable curl and shape, so that you can see the full length. It involves the use of a silicone rod placed against the eyelid, the lashes are then curled around the rod and then a special chemical lifting lotion is used to allow the lashes to set around the curling rod. A chemical setting lotion is then applied to set the lashes in place.\n\nThe procedure takes about 45-60 minutes and results should last 4-6 weeks, however they can last for longer or shorter time periods. I am aware that results vary between clients and results are dependent on many individual factors. I am aware that there is no guarantee that I will achieve desired results and that multiple treatment courses may to be needed to achieve or maintain desired results. The treatment is not painful, protective pads are placed on the eyelids to help prevent chemical solutions coming into contact with the skin. You must keep your eyes closed during the procedure to keep them protected from the chemical lotions used. If you wear contact lenses these should be removed before the procedure.\n\nI understand that several appointments may be necessary to produce optimal results and I will be notified, in advance of each session of treatment, about the location where the next treatment session is going to take place and the identity of who is going to be involved in my care at each stage.  I also understand that I will be kept informed of progress and that I can change my mind at any point.\n\n\nOccasionally clients may develop allergic reactions to one of the chemical lotions used during the lash lift procedure. Your technician will organise a patch test for you at least 48 hours before treatment. This involves you putting a small amount of the lotion onto your skin and observing if there is any rash or skin irritation. If there is any reaction the product should not be used on you. A normal patch test is a good indicator that you will not react to the chemical lotions, but it cannot exclude all severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis.\n\nRISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS: As with any procedure there are potential risks and complications associated. A lash lift is a safe and low risk procedure, but you must be aware of the following possible risks before proceeding. You must fully discuss any questions with your practitioner. \n  \nCommon side effects from lash lifting include mild soreness and skin irritation, redness of the skin and itching. These mild skin irritation symptoms should naturally settle after 2-3 days but could last longer. \n\nUncommonly you may experience damage or loss of eyelashes, rash or skin blistering.\n\nRarely you may experience an allergic reaction to the chemical products used. This often presents as a red, itchy rash with swelling but very rarely you could develop a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. In the event of an anaphylactic reaction you would need emergency medical attention. Other rare complications of lash lift include skin infection (cellulitis) or contact dermatitis.\n\nEye infection, irritation, chemical burn or abrasion injury can occur if chemical lotions or other products accidentally come into contact with your eyes/cornea. If severe injury occurs, then corneal scarring could lead to blindness in extremely rare cases. If you sustain an eye infection or injury then you should seek urgent medical attention.\n\nI have been advised of the relevant information associated with this treatment and I confirm that I fully understand this advice.  This includes advice about:\n\n- the aims/motivations for having the procedure and the desired outcome\n- the risks inherent in the procedure\n- the risks inherent in refusing the procedure\n- the risks specific to me\n- the expected benefits of the treatment\n- the potential disadvantages of the treatment\n- alternative procedures and their pros and cons - including the option of no treatment at all\n- any uncertainties about and the likelihood of success of the procedure\n- any follow-up treatment that may be required\n\nI agree to and authorise the taking of clinical photographs and videos.  I understand that these clinical photographs and videos will form part of and will be kept with my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I want and would need in order to make an informed decision.  I have been given the opportunity to discuss my desired outcome fully in order for me to make an informed decision.\n \n\nI certify that I have read the above consent and that I fully understand it.  I have been given ample opportunity for discussion and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction.  No new information has become available that affects my decision to have the treatment or my decision to consent. I hereby consent to the lash lift procedure.  This constitutes the full disclosure and supersedes any previous verbal or written disclosures."
