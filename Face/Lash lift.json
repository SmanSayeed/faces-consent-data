                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of the lash lift procedure. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, evaluating all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is important you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nA lash lift is a cosmetic procedure designed to give your natural eyelashes an enhanced curl and shape, making them appear longer and more lifted. It involves placing a silicone rod against the eyelid, carefully curling the lashes around it, and then applying a specialized chemical lifting lotion to set the curl. This is followed by a setting lotion to fix the lashes in their new position.\n\nThe procedure typically takes 45 to 60 minutes, and results generally last 4 to 6 weeks, though this duration can vary. I understand that outcomes differ between individuals and depend on many personal factors. I am aware there is no guarantee I will achieve my desired results and that multiple treatments may be necessary to attain or maintain them. The treatment is not painful; protective pads are placed on the eyelids to help prevent chemical contact with the skin. You must keep your eyes closed throughout the procedure to protect them from the lotions. If you wear contact lenses, they should be removed beforehand.\n\nI understand that several appointments may be required for optimal results. I will be notified in advance of each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept informed of my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nOccasionally, clients may develop an allergic reaction to one of the chemical solutions used. Your technician will arrange a patch test for you at least 48 hours before treatment. This involves applying a small amount of the product to your skin and monitoring for any rash or irritation. If a reaction occurs, the product should not be used on you. While a normal patch test is a good indicator, it cannot completely rule out the possibility of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, there are potential risks and complications. A lash lift is generally considered safe and low-risk, but you must be aware of the following possibilities before proceeding. You must discuss any questions fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include mild soreness, skin irritation, redness, or itching around the treated area. These symptoms usually subside naturally within 2 to 3 days but may last longer.\n\nLess common reactions may include damage to or loss of eyelashes, rash, or blistering of the skin.\n\nRarely, you may experience an allergic reaction to the chemical products. This often presents as a red, itchy rash with swelling, but in very rare cases, a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis could occur, requiring emergency medical attention. Other rare complications include skin infection (cellulitis) or contact dermatitis.\n\nEye infection, irritation, chemical burn, or abrasion can occur if the chemical solutions accidentally come into contact with your eyes or cornea. In extremely rare cases, severe injury could lead to corneal scarring and potential vision loss. Should you sustain any eye infection or injury, you must seek urgent medical attention.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and fully understand it. This advice includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking treatment and desired outcome\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of refusing the procedure\n- Any risks specific to me\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their pros and cons, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of success\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nI authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I require to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent, understand it fully, have had ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to the lash lift procedure. This document constitutes the complete disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
