                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form aims to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of powder brows. Please read this information attentively and discuss any questions fully with your provider before proceeding.\n\nYou should allocate sufficient time to consider this treatment carefully, evaluating all your alternatives before making an informed decision. It is essential that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that occur to you at any stage of the process.\n\nPowder brows, also called ombre or pixelated brows, is a semi-permanent cosmetic tattooing method that implants pigment into the upper dermal layer using a digital machine to produce a soft, powdered, graduated look similar to filled-in eyebrows with makeup. It creates fuller, more defined eyebrows lasting 1-3 years, suitable for all skin types including oily skin, with a natural appearance that lightens as it heals.\n\nThe procedure lasts 1-2 hours, involving numbing, shape planning, and layered pigment application from light to dark for a shaded effect, followed by a follow-up session 6-8 weeks later. Healing requires 4-6 weeks with initial darkness fading by about 50%; proper aftercare is vital. Due to factors such as skin type, lifestyle, metabolism, and overall health, you acknowledge that there are no guarantees, warranties, or promises of satisfaction with your outcome.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for best results. I will be informed ahead of each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, there are risks and potential complications. It is important that you are aware of these before proceeding. I am aware of the following potential risks/complications:\n\nCommon side effects include redness, swelling, tenderness, scabbing, itching, and initial excessive darkness for 4-7 days, with peeling around 7-10 days after the procedure. Color adjustments or slight asymmetry may happen during the healing phase.\n\nRare complications include infection, allergic reactions to pigment, scarring, granulomas, pigment movement, fading too quickly or not fading enough, keloid formation, or eye irritation. Not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding individuals, active skin issues, autoimmune diseases, Accutane use within the past year, or allergies to anesthetics/pigments.\n\nI understand that the treatment may involve risks of complication or injury from both known and unknown causes, and I voluntarily accept those risks. Before receiving treatment, I have been open in disclosing any condition that could affect this procedure.\n\nI confirm I have been provided with all relevant information regarding this treatment and fully comprehend it. This information includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking treatment and the results I want\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential drawbacks\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form, understand it completely, have been given ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete and final disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
