                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form aims to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of under-eye treatments. Please read this information attentively and discuss any questions fully with your provider before proceeding.\n\nYou should allow yourself the necessary time to consider this treatment carefully, weighing all your alternatives before making an informed decision. It is essential that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that occur to you at any stage of the process.\n\nUnder-eye treatments include non-surgical options such as dermal fillers, PRP therapy, laser resurfacing, and chemical peels to tackle dark circles, hollows, puffiness, fine lines, and thin skin in the sensitive under-eye region. These procedures restore volume, boost collagen production, improve skin texture, and brighten the appearance for a more rested, youthful look.\n\nProcedures differ: fillers offer instant volume (lasting 6-12 months), PRP uses growth factors from your own blood for natural skin renewal, lasers firm and refresh skin, with sessions taking 15-60 minutes and a series often recommended. Due to factors such as skin type, age, lifestyle, and overall health, you acknowledge that there are no guarantees, warranties, or promises of satisfaction with your outcome.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for best results. I will be informed ahead of each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, there are risks and potential complications. It is important that you are aware of these before proceeding. I am aware of the following potential risks/complications:\n\nCommon side effects include bruising, swelling, redness, tenderness at injection or laser sites, temporary dryness or flaking, which usually resolve within days to a week. Fillers may cause unevenness if not properly dissolved.\n\nRare complications include vascular occlusion (filler blocking a blood vessel), infection, allergic reactions, hyperpigmentation, prolonged swelling, Tyndall effect (a bluish tint from filler placed too shallow), or vision loss (extremely rare with fillers). Not recommended for active infections, bleeding disorders, or recent eye surgery.\n\nI understand that the treatment may involve risks of complication or injury from both known and unknown causes, and I voluntarily accept those risks. Before receiving treatment, I have been open in disclosing any condition that could affect this procedure.\n\nI confirm I have been provided with all relevant information regarding this treatment and fully comprehend it. This information includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking treatment and the results I desire\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential drawbacks\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form, understand it completely, have been given ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete and final disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
