                        "disclaimer": "This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of microblading. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, evaluating all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is important you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nOVERVIEW: Microblading is a form of cosmetic eyebrow tattooing classified as semi-permanent makeup. The procedure uses a manual tool containing fine needles to deposit small amounts of pigment superficially into the skin. It is designed to enhance or restore brow fullness, color, shape, and create a natural hair-stroke effect. Unlike traditional tattoos that place pigment deeper, microblading deposits pigment in the upper dermal layers, causing it to fade more quickly.\n\nTREATMENT PROCESS: Prior to your treatment appointment, you will have a consultation. During this session, your practitioner will discuss your goals and expectations, assist in selecting a pigment that matches your skin tone, ensure you are medically suitable for the procedure, and sketch a provisional brow shape with pencil for your approval. I accept responsibility for agreeing to the final color, shape, and placement of the microbladed eyebrows as determined during the consultation.\n\nMicroblading can cause discomfort. A topical anesthetic cream will be applied beforehand to help minimize this. The procedure typically takes 30 to 60 minutes, though duration may vary based on complexity and individual factors. I have been assured that the highest hygiene standards are maintained, using sterile, single-use needles and pigment containers for each client and session.\n\nPATCH TEST: Occasionally, clients may develop an allergic reaction to the pigment. Your practitioner will arrange a patch test at least 48 hours before treatment. This involves applying a small amount of pigment to your skin and observing for any rash or irritation. If a reaction occurs, the product should not be used. While a normal patch test is a good indicator, it cannot completely exclude the possibility of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. I hereby consent to a patch test prior to treatment.\n\nRESULTS: I understand that results vary significantly between individuals and depend on many personal factors. I understand and accept that microblading is a process typically requiring multiple sessions to achieve desired outcomes, and that perfect results cannot be guaranteed after the first procedure. Most people require at least two treatments to achieve or maintain their desired look. I acknowledge there is a possibility I may never achieve my ideal results.\n\nI understand that several appointments may be necessary for optimal results. I will be notified in advance of each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept informed of my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nI have been advised that the true, settled color will be visible approximately one month after each procedure, and that pigment appearance can vary based on skin tone, type, age, and condition. I understand that some skin types retain pigment better than others, and no exact color guarantee can be given. I acknowledge that my skin's natural tone may slightly alter the final pigment color.\n\nI fully understand and accept that non-toxic pigments are used and that the results will gradually fade over a period of 1 to 3 years. Even after visible fading, pigment particles may remain in the skin indefinitely. There are no guarantees regarding the success or longevity of the microblading treatment.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, there are potential risks and complications. You must be aware of all the following risks before proceeding. You must discuss any questions fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon reactions include pain or discomfort during or after the procedure. It is common for the eyebrow area to appear red and swollen afterward, with possible minor bleeding, bruising, or scabbing. These effects can last up to 14 days or longer, and complete healing can take up to 30 days.\n\nLess common complications include skin infection (cellulitis), presenting as hot, red, shiny skin, possibly with pus and general malaise. Infection is uncommon if aftercare advice is followed, but if suspected, you must see a doctor promptly. Some individuals may feel faint during needle-based procedures; you must inform your practitioner immediately if you feel unwell. Other uncommon risks include unsatisfactory cosmetic results, lack of results, rapid color fading, inconsistent pigment, and pigment spreading or 'fanning.' Cosmetic tattoo pigments can often be permanent despite the 'semi-permanent' label. They are difficult to remove, and poor results may require corrective treatments or tattoo removal (e.g., laser). You must also inform any doctor or radiologist if you need an MRI scan after microblading, as tattooed skin can pose issues during scanning.\n\nRare complications include unsightly hypertrophic or keloid scarring, delayed inflammatory nodule (granuloma) formation, skin reactions to the topical anesthetic, and allergic reactions. Despite a normal patch test, allergic reactions to pigments are still possible, presenting as swelling, a red rash, or blistering. Very rarely, an anaphylactic reaction could occur, requiring emergency medical attention. Severe allergic or inflammatory reactions may result in permanent scarring.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and fully understand it. This advice includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking treatment and desired outcome\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of refusing the procedure\n- Any risks specific to me\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their pros and cons, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of success\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I require to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nTo my knowledge, I do not have any physical, mental, or medical condition that might adversely affect my well-being as a result of deciding to undergo this procedure now. I agree to follow all pre- and post-procedure instructions provided by the technician. Failure to do so may compromise my chances of a successful outcome. I confirm I have received a copy of the aftercare details. I have been informed of the nature, risks, possible complications, and consequences of semi-permanent skin pigmentation.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent, understand it fully, have had ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
