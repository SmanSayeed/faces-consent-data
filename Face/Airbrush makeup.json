                        "paraphrased_disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form aims to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of airbrush makeup. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your provider before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the necessary time to consider this service thoroughly, weighing all your alternatives before making an informed decision. It is essential that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that occur to you at any stage of the process.\n\nAirbrush makeup is a professional application method that uses a spray device to deliver a fine mist of water-based, lightweight makeup for a seamless, natural appearance that is durable, smudge-resistant, and suitable for all skin types, including sensitive or acne-prone skin. It provides uniform coverage, moves with the skin, and is perfect for events, photography, or everyday use without blocking pores.\n\nThe session lasts 30-60 minutes, involving skin preparation, custom color blending, and precise spraying in thin layers for adjustable coverage, followed by setting. The results last 8-18 hours or more depending on weather and skin preparation; touch-ups might be needed for lengthy occasions. Due to factors such as skin type, condition, lifestyle, and overall health, you acknowledge that there are no guarantees, warranties, or promises of satisfaction with your results.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for best results. I will be informed ahead of each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, there are risks and potential complications. It is important that you are aware of these before proceeding. I am aware of the following potential risks/complications:\n\nCommon side effects include a temporary slight tanning effect if bronzer is used, mild dryness, or residue if not properly removed, minimal risk of inhaling particles during application. No recovery time is needed.\n\nRare complications include allergic reactions to ingredients causing redness or itching, breakouts in acne-prone skin if the product is unsuitable, inhalation irritation if oversprayed, or uneven application if skin is not adequately prepped. Not recommended for individuals with asthma, pregnancy, open sores, or known allergies to makeup components; a patch test is advised.\n\nI understand that the service may involve risks of complication or injury from both known and unknown causes, and I voluntarily accept those risks. Before receiving the service, I have been open in disclosing any condition that could affect this procedure.\n\nI confirm I have been provided with all relevant information regarding this service and fully understand it. This information includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking this service and the desired outcome\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative services and their advantages and disadvantages, including the option of no service\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form, understand it completely, have been given ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo the service or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete and final disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
