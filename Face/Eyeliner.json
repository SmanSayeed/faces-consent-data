                        "paraphrased_disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form aims to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of eyeliner tattooing. Please read this information attentively and discuss any questions fully with your provider before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the necessary time to consider this treatment carefully, weighing all your alternatives before making an informed decision. It is essential that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that occur to you at any stage of the process.\n\nEyeliner tattoo, also referred to as permanent eyeliner, is a semi-permanent cosmetic tattooing procedure that implants pigment along the lash line using a needle to enhance eye definition, create the appearance of fuller lashes, and reduce the need for daily makeup. It provides a crisp, smudge-resistant line lasting 1-5 years, customizable from a subtle to a bold style.\n\nThe session lasts 1-2 hours, involving topical anesthesia, shape outlining, and machine-based pigment insertion into the skin, with a follow-up session 6-8 weeks later. Healing includes initial darkness lightening 30-50% over 4-6 weeks; strict aftercare is essential to avoid fading or issues. Due to factors such as skin type, lifestyle, metabolism, and overall health, you acknowledge that there are no guarantees, warranties, or promises of satisfaction with your results.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for best results. I will be informed ahead of each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, there are risks and potential complications. It is important that you are aware of these before proceeding. I am aware of the following potential risks/complications:\n\nCommon side effects include swelling, redness, tenderness, crusting, itching, and temporary blurring or over-thickening of the line for 7-10 days, with color stabilizing to a lighter shade.\n\nRare complications include infection, allergic reactions to pigment causing swelling or granulomas, scarring, pigment migration, uneven fading, keloid formation, eye irritation or corneal abrasion if pigment spreads, or severe allergic reaction to anesthetics. Not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding individuals, dry or eczema-prone skin, autoimmune conditions, Accutane use within the past year, or allergies to pigments/anesthetics.\n\nI understand that the treatment may involve risks of complication or injury from both known and unknown causes, and I voluntarily accept those risks. Before receiving treatment, I have been open in disclosing any condition that could affect this procedure.\n\nI confirm I have been provided with all relevant information regarding this treatment and fully comprehend it. This information includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking treatment and the results I desire\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form, understand it completely, have been given ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete and final disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
