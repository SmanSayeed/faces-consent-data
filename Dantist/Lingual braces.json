                        "disclaimer": "Lingual braces are orthodontic appliances that are attached to the back (lingual) surfaces of the teeth, making them less visible than traditional braces. They work similarly to standard braces by gradually moving teeth into better alignment using brackets, wires, and gentle, continuous pressure. They are often chosen for cosmetic reasons by individuals who wish to straighten their teeth discreetly.\n\nRisks may include discomfort, tongue irritation, difficulty speaking initially, difficulty cleaning teeth leading to higher risk of plaque buildup or decay, gum irritation, allergic reactions to metals, root shortening, relapse of tooth position after treatment, and prolonged treatment time in some cases.\n\nBenefits may include discreet teeth straightening, improved dental aesthetics, better bite alignment, and long-term oral health benefits.\n\nAlternatives may include traditional braces, ceramic braces, clear aligners (e.g., Invisalign), or choosing no treatment.\n\nInformed Consent and Photography\nI have been advised of the relevant information associated with this treatment and I confirm that I fully understand this advice. This includes advice about:\n\nthe aims/motivations for having the procedure and the desired outcome\nthe risks inherent in the procedure\nthe risks inherent in refusing the procedure\nthe risks specific to me\nthe expected benefits of the treatment\nthe potential disadvantages of the treatment\nalternative procedures and their pros and cons – including the option of no treatment at all\nany uncertainties about and the likelihood of success of the procedure\nany follow-up treatment that may be required\n\nClinical Photographs and Videos: I agree to and authorise the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand that these clinical photographs and videos will form part of and will be kept with my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I want and would need in order to make an informed decision. I have been given the opportunity to discuss my desired outcome fully in order for me to make an informed decision.\n\nI certify that I have read the above consent and that I fully understand it. I have been given ample opportunity for discussion and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has become available that affects my decision to have the treatment or my decision to consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This constitutes the full disclosure and supersedes any previous verbal or written disclosures.\n\nAll deposits and booking fees are non-refundable unless agreed to with the practitioner."
