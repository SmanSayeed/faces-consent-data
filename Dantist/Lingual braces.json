                        "disclaimer": "Lingual braces are orthodontic devices fixed to the inner (tongue-side) surfaces of the teeth, rendering them more concealed than conventional braces. They function in a similar manner to regular braces, employing brackets and wires to apply gentle, continuous force that gradually shifts teeth into improved alignment. They are frequently selected for aesthetic considerations by those seeking a less noticeable method of straightening their teeth.\n\nPotential risks may include initial discomfort or soreness, irritation of the tongue, temporary challenges with speech, increased difficulty in cleaning teeth which could elevate the risk of plaque accumulation or tooth decay, gum inflammation, allergic responses to metal components, potential shortening of tooth roots, possible relapse of tooth alignment after treatment completion, and, in certain cases, an extended treatment duration.\n\nPotential benefits may include discreet orthodontic correction, enhanced dental appearance, improved bite function, and long-term advantages for oral health.\n\nAlternative options may include traditional metal braces, ceramic (tooth-colored) braces, clear removable aligners (such as Invisalign), or deciding against any orthodontic treatment.\n\nInformed Consent and Photography\nI confirm that I have been informed about all relevant aspects of this treatment and that I fully comprehend this advice. This includes information regarding:\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure itself\n- The risks associated with declining the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The anticipated benefits of the treatment\n- Potential drawbacks or disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the choice to have no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any follow-up care that might be necessary\n\nClinical Photographs and Videos: I authorize the capture of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these images will become a part of my confidential medical file and will be stored accordingly.\n\nI have been asked what details I require to make an informed choice and have had the chance to discuss my desired outcome thoroughly.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent document and understand it completely. I have been provided sufficient opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has emerged that alters my decision to undergo the procedure or to provide my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document serves as the complete disclosure and replaces any prior verbal or written communications.\n\nAll deposits and booking fees are non-refundable unless otherwise agreed upon with the practitioner."
