                        "disclaimer": "This document serves as your consent to proceed with the dental teeth whitening treatment. Please read through the information below carefully and sign the document to confirm your understanding.\n\nTreatment Overview:\nTeeth whitening is a common dental procedure designed to lighten the colour of your teeth using a bleaching agent, usually containing carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide. This treatment can be performed in the office under a dentist's supervision or at home using take-home trays.\n\nBenefits:\nTeeth whitening can significantly improve the appearance of discoloured or stained teeth. This can boost self-esteem and confidence, creating a positive impact on social interactions and personal well-being.\n\nPotential Risks and Side Effects:\nSensitivity: Teeth may become sensitive during or after treatment. This is typically temporary and decreases over time.\n\nGum Irritation: The whitening solution may irritate your gums, causing inflammation or redness.\n\nUneven Whitening: If you have fillings, crowns, or veneers, these will not change colour during whitening, potentially leading to uneven tooth colour.\n\nOverbleaching: Overuse of whitening products can damage the tooth enamel or gum tissue.\n\nAlternatives:\nAlternatives to teeth whitening include veneers, dental crowns, bonding, or simply choosing not to lighten the colour of your teeth. Each option has its own set of risks, benefits, and costs, which should be discussed with your dentist.\n\nBy signing below, you affirm that:\n\nYou have read and understood the information provided above.\nYou have had an opportunity to ask questions and all your questions have been answered to your satisfaction.\nYou understand the risks and benefits of the teeth whitening treatment and agree to proceed with the treatment.\nYou agree to follow all post-care instructions given by your dental care provider.\nYou are not allergic to any of the ingredients used in the whitening gel.\n\nI have been advised of the relevant information associated with this treatment and I confirm that I fully understand this advice.  This includes advice about:\n\n- the aims/motivations for having the procedure and the desired outcome\n- the risks inherent in the procedure\n- the risks inherent in refusing the procedure\n- the risks specific to me\n- the expected benefits of the treatment\n- the potential disadvantages of the treatment\n- alternative procedures and their pros and cons - including the option of no treatment at all\n- any uncertainties about and the likelihood of success of the procedure\n- any follow-up treatment that may be required\n\nCLINICAL PHOTOS AND VIDEOS: I agree to and authorise the taking of clinical photographs and videos.  I understand that these clinical photographs and videos will form part of and will be kept with my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I want and would need in order to make an informed decision.  I have been given the opportunity to discuss my desired outcome fully in order for me to make an informed decision.\n\nI certify that I have read the above consent and that I fully understand it. I have been given ample opportunity for discussion and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has become available that affects my decision to have the treatment or my decision to consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This constitutes the full disclosure and supersedes any previous verbal or written disclosures."
