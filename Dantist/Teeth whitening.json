                        "disclaimer": "This document constitutes your agreement to proceed with the dental teeth whitening procedure. Please review the following details thoroughly and sign to confirm your understanding and acceptance.\n\nTreatment Summary:\nTeeth whitening is a widely used cosmetic dental treatment aimed at lightening the natural shade of teeth through the application of a bleaching agent, typically containing carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide. This can be administered in a dental clinic under professional supervision or via custom take-home trays for personal use.\n\nAdvantages:\nTeeth whitening can markedly enhance the look of teeth affected by discoloration or stains. This improvement may increase self-assurance and confidence, positively influencing social engagement and personal satisfaction.\n\nPossible Risks and Side Effects:\nSensitivity: Teeth may develop temporary heightened sensitivity to temperature or pressure during or after the procedure, which generally subsides over time.\nGum Irritation: The whitening solution may cause temporary inflammation, redness, or mild irritation of the gum tissue.\nUneven Results: Existing dental restorations such as fillings, crowns, or veneers will not respond to the whitening agent, which could result in a non-uniform appearance.\nOver-bleaching: Excessive or improper use of whitening products may harm tooth enamel or aggravate gum tissue.\n\nAlternative Options:\nAlternatives to professional teeth whitening include porcelain veneers, dental crowns, composite bonding, or opting not to alter tooth color. Each alternative carries its own considerations regarding risks, benefits, and expenses, which should be discussed with your dental practitioner.\n\nBy signing, you acknowledge that:\nYou have read and comprehended the information provided.\nYou have been given the opportunity to ask questions, and all inquiries have been addressed to your satisfaction.\nYou are aware of the potential risks and benefits associated with teeth whitening and agree to proceed with the treatment.\nYou commit to following all aftercare instructions provided by your dental professional.\nYou do not have a known allergy to any components in the whitening gel.\n\nI confirm that I have been informed about all relevant aspects of this treatment and that I fully comprehend this advice. This includes information regarding:\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure itself\n- The risks associated with declining the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The anticipated benefits of the treatment\n- Potential drawbacks or disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the choice to have no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any follow-up care that might be necessary\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I require to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent, understand it fully, have had ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
