                        "disclaimer": "Cyst removal is a minor surgical procedure performed to excise a cyst, which is a closed sac-like structure filled with fluid, pus, or other material. The procedure typically involves local anesthesia, making a small incision, removing the cyst and its sac, and then closing the wound with sutures if necessary. This helps prevent recurrence and allows for healing.\n\nRisks and Side Effects:\n\nPossible risks include bleeding, infection, pain, swelling, scarring, recurrence of the cyst, allergic reaction to anesthesia, delayed wound healing, nerve damage (rare), or changes in skin sensation. In some cases, the cyst may recur if the entire sac is not removed.\n\nContraindications:\n\nThe procedure may be postponed or avoided if there is an active infection at the site, uncontrolled bleeding disorders, severe skin inflammation, or certain medical conditions that impair healing.\n\nAftercare:\n\nKeep the wound clean and dry as instructed. Change dressings as advised and avoid strenuous activity that could strain the wound. Watch for signs of infection, such as redness, increased swelling, pus, or fever, and contact your healthcare provider if they occur. Follow up for suture removal if necessary.\n\nInformed Consent and Photography\nI have been advised of the relevant information associated with this treatment and I confirm that I fully understand this advice.
