                        "disclaimer": "Cyst excision is a minor surgical intervention carried out to remove a cyst—a closed sac-like structure containing fluid, pus, or other material. The procedure generally involves administering local anesthesia, making a small incision, extracting the cyst along with its surrounding sac, and then closing the incision with stitches if required. This approach aims to prevent the cyst from returning and facilitates proper healing.\n\nRisks and Potential Complications:\n\nPossible risks include bleeding, infection, pain, swelling, scarring, recurrence of the cyst, allergic reaction to the anesthetic, delayed wound healing, nerve damage (rare), or alterations in skin sensation near the site. In some instances, if the entire cyst wall is not completely removed, the cyst may grow back.\n\nContraindications:\n\nThe procedure might be delayed or avoided if there is an active infection at the intended site, uncontrolled bleeding disorders, severe skin inflammation, or certain medical conditions that could impair the body's healing process.\n\nAftercare Instructions:\n\nKeep the wound clean and dry as directed. Change dressings according to the provided instructions and avoid vigorous activities that could stress the wound area. Monitor for signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, pus discharge, or fever, and contact your healthcare provider if these occur. Attend any scheduled follow-up appointments for suture removal if applicable.\n\nInformed Consent and Photography\nI confirm that I have been informed about all relevant aspects of this procedure and that I fully comprehend this advice. This includes information regarding:\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure itself\n- The risks associated with declining the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The anticipated benefits of the treatment\n- Potential drawbacks or disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the choice to have no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any follow-up care that might be necessary\n\nClinical Photographs and Videos: I authorize the capture of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these images will become a part of my confidential medical file and will be stored accordingly.\n\nI have been asked what details I require to make an informed choice and have had the chance to discuss my desired outcome thoroughly.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent document and understand it completely. I have been provided sufficient opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has emerged that alters my decision to undergo the procedure or to provide my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document serves as the complete disclosure and replaces any prior verbal or written communications.\n\nAll deposits and booking fees are non-refundable unless otherwise agreed upon with the practitioner."
