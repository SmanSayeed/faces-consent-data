                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of a chemical peel. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nA chemical peel involves applying a chemical solution to the skin to remove its outermost layers. The new skin that grows back is typically smoother and has an improved cosmetic appearance. Chemical peels can be used to enhance the look of lines and wrinkles, dull skin, minor scars, acne, and areas of discoloration.\n\nThere are three main types of chemical peels: light, medium, and deep. These classifications refer to the depth of skin layer removal. Deeper peels require a longer healing period but often yield more pronounced results. Light peels are gentler but may need to be performed more frequently to achieve desired outcomes. A deep chemical peel should only be done once, as repeated deep peels could harm the skin.\n\nMultiple sessions of lighter peels are often needed for optimal results, spaced appropriately. Due to variables like age, skin condition, sun exposure, smoking, skincare routine, climate, lifestyle, and general health, you acknowledge that there are no guarantees, warranties, or assurances of satisfaction with your results. The skin can take up to 14 days to heal after a chemical peel, and repeat peels should not be performed within this two-week period. Subsequent peels are typically scheduled at 4 to 6-week intervals.\n\nI understand that several appointments may be necessary for optimal results. I will be notified in advance of each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept informed of my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, there are risks and complications involved. It is important that you are aware of these before proceeding. I am aware of the following potential risks/complications:\n\nCommon side effects include mild to moderate discomfort or pain following the procedure, slight redness or swelling of the skin, increased sun sensitivity, and general heightened skin sensitivity. These effects can last up to 14 days, which is the typical skin healing time post-peel. Occasionally, skin redness may persist longer than 14 days. Less commonly, changes in skin pigmentation may occur; the skin may become lighter or darker. In some cases, these pigment changes can be permanent.\n\nRare complications include allergic reactions to the chemical product, which could include a severe anaphylactic reaction requiring emergency medical care. Bacterial skin infection (cellulitis) or reactivation of herpes virus infections are also possible. Permanent scarring is another rare possibility.\n\nI understand that the treatment may involve risks of complication or injury from both known and unknown causes, and I freely assume those risks. Before receiving treatment, I have been candid in disclosing any condition that may have a bearing on this procedure.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and fully understand it. This advice includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking treatment and desired outcome\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of refusing the procedure\n- Any risks specific to me\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their pros and cons, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of success\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I require to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent, understand it fully, have had ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
