                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT CONSENT: This is an informed consent form that has been prepared to help inform you of the potential benefits and risks of carbon laser treatment. It is important that you read this information carefully and discuss fully with your practitioner before proceeding with treatment.\n\nIt is also important that you take as much time as you need to consider the treatment carefully, weighing up all your options before reaching an informed decision.  It is essential that you are aware of your right to have a second opinion and you are encouraged to ask any questions that come to mind throughout the entirety of the process.\n\n\nA carbon laser facial is a treatment designed to rejuvenate the skin. It can be used for many reasons including tired and aged skin, pigmentation, acne and enlarged pores. It is a two-step process; the first step involves placement of a carbon lotion and laser application to generate heat. The heat created induces skin remodeling and collagen production which leads to skin rejuvenation. The second step involves removal of the carbon lotion with laser that has an exfoliation effect. \n\nRISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS: Carbon laser peel is a safe procedure however, there are some possible small risks you should be informed of. You may experience some mild discomfort during the treatment, these include small pin prick sensation and/ or a warming effect. These are usually mild and well tolerated.\n\nAfter the treatment you commonly may notice some redness and mild swelling, these should resolve within 2 weeks. Rare side effects include blisters, hyperpigmentation, infection, or scarring. In the case of any of these you must contact your practitioner and may require medical assessment. \n\nI have been advised of the relevant information associated with this treatment and I confirm that I fully understand this advice.  This includes advice about:\n\n- the aims/motivations for having the procedure and the desired outcome\n- the risks inherent in the procedure\n- the risks inherent in refusing the procedure\n- the risks specific to me\n- the expected benefits of the treatment\n- the potential disadvantages of the treatment\n- alternative procedures and their pros and cons - including the option of no treatment at all\n- any uncertainties about and the likelihood of success of the procedure\n- any follow-up treatment that may be required\n\nCLINICAL PHOTOS AND VIDEOS: I agree to and authorise the taking of clinical photographs and videos.  I understand that these clinical photographs and videos will form part of and will be kept with my confidential medical records.\n\n\n\nI have been asked what information I want and would need in order to make an informed decision.  I have been given the opportunity to discuss my desired outcome fully in order for me to make an informed decision.\n\nI certify that I have read the above consent and that I fully understand it. I have been given ample opportunity for discussion and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has become available that affects my decision to have the treatment or my decision to consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This constitutes the full disclosure and supersedes any previous verbal or written disclosures."
