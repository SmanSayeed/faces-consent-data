                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to provide you with essential information regarding the advantages and potential risks associated with a Superficial Chemical Peel. We encourage you to read this carefully and discuss any specific concerns with your practitioner before starting the session.\n\nA superficial peel is a skin-resurfacing procedure that involves the application of mild chemical solutions (such as AHA or BHA) to remove the outermost layer of the epidermis. The treatment consists of two phases: first, the skin is prepared and the chemical solution is applied to gently exfoliate and stimulate cell turnover; second, the solution is neutralized or removed, often followed by the application of soothing agents to protect the new skin layer. This procedure can help improve skin tone, texture, and minor imperfections.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS: While superficial peels are considered low-risk with minimal downtime, there are potential adverse effects. During the application, you may feel a tingling, stinging, or warm sensation. These feelings are typically brief and manageable.\n\nFollowing the treatment, it is normal to experience redness, dryness, and mild flaking as the skin renews itself, usually resolving within a few days. Less common risks include temporary skin darkening or lightening (pigment changes), persistent irritation, or very rarely, infection or scarring if aftercare instructions are not followed. If you notice any unusual blistering or severe crusting, you should contact your provider immediately.\n\nI confirm that I have been informed about the nature of this treatment and fully understand the following:\n- The purpose of the peel and the aesthetic results I hope to see\n- The common risks such as peeling, redness, and sun sensitivity\n- The risks linked to deciding against the procedure\n- Any personal health or skin history specific to me (e.g., history of cold sores)\n- The expected benefits of smoother and clearer skin\n- Alternative treatment choices and their benefits and drawbacks\n- The critical importance of sun protection and specific aftercare post-treatment\n\nMEDICAL PHOTOGRAPHY: I grant permission for clinical photos and videos to be taken. I understand these will be added to my confidential medical file.\n\nI have been asked what details I need to make an informed choice and have had the chance to discuss my objectives thoroughly.\n\nI attest that I have read this consent form, understand it completely, and have had all my questions answered to my satisfaction. I hereby agree to this procedure. This document represents the full and final agreement and replaces any previous verbal or written statements."
