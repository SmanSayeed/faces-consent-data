                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to provide you with essential information regarding the advantages and potential risks associated with a Mandelic Acid Peel. We encourage you to review this carefully and discuss any specific concerns with your practitioner before starting the session.\n\nA mandelic peel is a gentle Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) derived from bitter almonds. Due to its larger molecular size, it penetrates the skin more slowly and uniformly than other acids, making it an excellent choice for sensitive skin, acne-prone skin, and those with darker skin tones (higher Fitzpatrick scales) who may be prone to hyperpigmentation. The procedure consists of two phases: first, the mandelic solution is applied to exfoliate dead skin cells and clear congestion within the pores; second, the solution is neutralized and removed to reveal a clearer, more balanced complexion. This treatment is particularly effective for addressing acne, fine lines, and irregular pigmentation.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS: Mandelic peels are considered very low-risk; however, minor potential adverse effects can occur. During the application, you might feel a mild tingling or a warm sensation. These feelings are generally minimal and subside quickly upon neutralization.\n\nFollowing the treatment, mild redness or light flaking is normal and typically resolves within a few days. Less common reactions include temporary skin irritation, localized swelling, or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation if the skin is not properly protected from the sun. If you notice any persistent blistering or severe irritation, you should contact your provider immediately.\n\nI confirm that I have been informed about the nature of this treatment and fully understand the following:\n- The purpose of the mandelic peel and the results I hope to see\n- The minimal risks, including temporary redness and increased sun sensitivity\n- The risks linked to deciding against the procedure\n- Any personal health or skin history specific to me\n- The expected benefits of clearer skin and improved texture\n- Alternative treatment choices and their benefits and drawbacks\n- The requirement to follow all post-treatment aftercare, especially sun protection\n\nMEDICAL PHOTOGRAPHY: I grant permission for clinical photos and videos to be taken. I understand these will be added to my confidential medical file.\n\nI attest that I have read this consent form, understand it completely, and have had all my questions answered to my satisfaction. I hereby agree to this procedure. This document represents the full and final agreement."
