                        "paraphrased_disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document provides essential information regarding the advantages and significant risks associated with a Deep Chemical Peel (such as Phenol or high-concentration TCA). This is a major skin-resurfacing procedure. Please review this carefully and have an in-depth discussion with your provider before deciding to proceed.\n\nA deep chemical peel is designed to penetrate the mid-to-lower layers of the dermis to treat severe skin concerns, including deep wrinkles, significant sun damage, or pre-cancerous growths. The procedure consists of two primary phases: first, the application of a potent chemical solution that intentionally causes controlled injury to the deeper skin layers; second, a recovery phase where the skin undergoes a significant healing and regeneration process. Due to the intensity of this treatment, it often requires sedation or local anesthesia and involves a substantial recovery period.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS: A deep peel carries higher risks than superficial or medium peels. During the procedure, significant discomfort or stinging is expected. Following the treatment, you will experience intense redness, swelling, and crusting that may last several weeks.\n\nSerious potential adverse effects include permanent skin lightening (hypopigmentation) or darkening (hyperpigmentation), scarring, and infection. Because certain deep peel solutions can affect heart rhythm, cardiac monitoring may be required during application. If you notice any signs of abnormal healing, severe pain, or fever, you must contact your provider immediately.\n\nI confirm that I have been advised about all relevant details of this treatment and fully understand this guidance, including:\n- The intensive nature of the procedure and the dramatic results expected\n- The significant risks, including permanent pigment changes and scarring\n- The requirement for strict adherence to a long-term recovery and aftercare protocol\n- The necessity of avoiding sun exposure for several months post-procedure\n- Any personal health risks, specifically related to heart, kidney, or liver function\n- Alternative options, including less invasive peels or surgical intervention\n\nMEDICAL PHOTOGRAPHY: I give permission for clinical photos and videos to be taken for my confidential medical file to track the extensive healing process.\n\nI attest that I have read this form, understand the gravity of the procedure and the required downtime, and all my questions have been answered. I hereby agree to this procedure. This document represents the full and final agreement."
