                        "disclaimer": "A Jessner peel is a medium-depth chemical peel that uses a combination of salicylic acid, lactic acid, and resorcinol in an ethanol base to exfoliate the outer layers of skin. It is used to improve skin tone, texture, and clarity, and can help treat acne, pigmentation, fine lines, and sun damage. The treatment works by removing damaged skin cells, stimulating collagen production, and promoting the growth of new, healthy skin.\n\nRisks may include redness, swelling, irritation, peeling, crusting, changes in skin colour (hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation), scarring, infection, allergic reactions, sensitivity to sunlight, and prolonged healing.\n\nBenefits may include smoother skin texture, reduced acne breakouts, lightening of pigmentation, diminished appearance of fine lines, and a more even skin tone.\n\nAlternatives may include other chemical peels of varying depths, microdermabrasion, laser resurfacing, microneedling, topical treatments, or choosing no treatment at all.\n\nInformed Consent and Photography\nI have been advised of the relevant information associated with this treatment and I confirm that I fully understand this advice.
