                        "disclaimer": "A Jessner peel is a medium-depth chemical exfoliation treatment that utilizes a blend of salicylic acid, lactic acid, and resorcinol in an ethanol solution to remove the outer layers of skin. It is employed to enhance skin tone, texture, and clarity, and can assist in managing acne, pigmentation irregularities, fine lines, and sun-induced damage. The procedure works by eliminating impaired skin cells, encouraging collagen synthesis, and fostering the development of new, healthier skin.\n\nPotential risks may include redness, swelling, irritation, flaking, crust formation, alterations in skin color (either darkening or lightening), scarring, infection, allergic responses, increased sun sensitivity, and extended recovery time.\n\nPotential benefits may include improved skin smoothness, decreased acne occurrences, lightening of discolored areas, reduction in the visibility of fine lines, and a more uniform skin complexion.\n\nAlternative options may include other chemical peels of different strengths, microdermabrasion, laser skin resurfacing, microneedling, topical skincare regimens, or choosing to forgo treatment.\n\nInformed Consent and Photography\nI confirm that I have been informed about all relevant aspects of this treatment and that I fully comprehend this advice. This includes information regarding:\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure itself\n- The risks associated with declining the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The anticipated benefits of the treatment\n- Potential drawbacks or disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the choice to have no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any follow-up care that might be necessary\n\nClinical Photographs and Videos: I authorize the capture of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these images will become a part of my confidential medical file and will be stored accordingly.\n\nI have been asked what details I require to make an informed choice and have had the chance to discuss my desired outcome thoroughly.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent document and understand it completely. I have been provided sufficient opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has emerged that alters my decision to undergo the procedure or to provide my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document serves as the complete disclosure and replaces any prior verbal or written communications.\n\nAll deposits and booking fees are non-refundable unless otherwise agreed upon with the practitioner."
