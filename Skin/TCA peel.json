                        "disclaimer": "A TCA peel is a non-surgical treatment that uses trichloroacetic acid to exfoliate the outer layers of the skin. It helps reduce the appearance of fine lines, pigmentation, acne scars, and uneven skin texture, promoting smoother and more radiant skin.\n\nRisks and Complications\nCommon side effects include redness, swelling, peeling, tightness, and sensitivity. Temporary or permanent changes in skin pigmentation, scarring, or infection are rare but possible. Individuals with darker skin tones may have an increased risk of pigmentation changes.\n\nPre-Treatment Requirements\nInform your practitioner of your full medical history, current medications, allergies, and recent skin treatments. Avoid sun exposure, waxing, or use of retinoids at least 1 week prior to the peel. A patch test may be done to assess skin sensitivity.\n\nPost-Treatment Aftercare\nFollowing the peel, the skin will appear red and begin peeling over several days. Avoid picking or peeling flaking skin. Apply only recommended moisturisers and sun protection. Avoid direct sun exposure, strenuous exercise, and the use of harsh products for at least one week.\n\nInformed Consent and Photography\nI have been advised of the relevant information associated with this treatment and I confirm that I fully understand this advice.
