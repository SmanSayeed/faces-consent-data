                        "disclaimer": "A TCA peel is a non-surgical cosmetic treatment that utilizes trichloroacetic acid to exfoliate the skin's superficial layers. It aims to diminish the appearance of fine lines, discoloration, acne scarring, and uneven texture, encouraging a smoother and more luminous complexion.\n\nPotential Risks and Complications\nCommon reactions include redness, swelling, peeling, tightness, and increased sensitivity. Rare but possible adverse events encompass temporary or lasting alterations in skin pigmentation, scarring, or infection. Individuals with darker complexions may have a heightened risk of pigmentation changes.\n\nPre-Procedure Requirements\nDisclose your complete medical history, current medications, allergies, and recent skin treatments to your practitioner. Avoid sun exposure, waxing, and retinoid use for at least one week before the peel. A patch test may be conducted to evaluate skin tolerance.\n\nPost-Procedure Aftercare\nFollowing the peel, the skin will appear red and will begin to flake over several days. Refrain from picking or manually peeling the skin. Use only recommended moisturizers and high-SPF sunscreen. Avoid direct sunlight, intense physical activity, and harsh skincare products for a minimum of one week.\n\nInformed Consent and Photography\nI confirm that I have been informed about all relevant aspects of this treatment and that I fully comprehend this advice. This includes information regarding:\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure itself\n- The risks associated with declining the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The anticipated benefits of the treatment\n- Potential drawbacks or disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the choice to have no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any follow-up care that might be necessary\n\nClinical Photographs and Videos: I authorize the capture of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these images will become a part of my confidential medical file and will be stored accordingly.\n\nI have been asked what details I require to make an informed choice and have had the chance to discuss my desired outcome thoroughly.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent document and understand it completely. I have been provided sufficient opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has emerged that alters my decision to undergo the procedure or to provide my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document serves as the complete disclosure and replaces any prior verbal or written communications.\n\nAll deposits and booking fees are non-refundable unless otherwise agreed upon with the practitioner."
