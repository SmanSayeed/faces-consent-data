                        "consentFormName": "Salicylic Peel",
                        "disclaimer": "A Salicylic Peel is a chemical exfoliation procedure that employs salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid (BHA), to address acne, excess oil, and clogged pores. It functions by penetrating into the pores to dissolve oil and dead skin cells, helping to diminish breakouts and refine skin texture. Salicylic acid also possesses anti-inflammatory characteristics, making it particularly suitable for those with acne-prone or oily skin.\n\nThe process generally involves cleansing the skin, applying the salicylic acid solution for a designated time, and then neutralizing or removing it. The acid concentration can be adjusted based on the severity of the skin issue and the intended depth of exfoliation.\n\nRisks involved in undergoing a Salicylic Peel include redness, dryness, temporary flaking, mild irritation, increased sun sensitivity, and in some instances, post-inflammatory darkening of the skin or an allergic response. Risks associated with declining treatment may include ongoing or worsening acne, persistent clogged pores, uneven skin texture, and excess oil production. Risks specific to my situation may include increased sensitivity or irritation depending on my skin type, any history of skin inflammation, or my current skincare routine.\n\nThe anticipated benefits of a Salicylic Peel include clearer pores, fewer acne blemishes, improved skin smoothness, reduced oiliness, and a more radiant overall appearance. Potential drawbacks include the possible need for multiple sessions for optimal results, a brief recovery period with potential peeling, and the requirement for strict sun protection.\n\nAlternative options include other chemical peels (such as glycolic or lactic acid), microdermabrasion, laser therapies, prescription topical retinoids, or choosing no treatment. Each alternative carries its own set of benefits, limitations, and potential risks.\n\nThere are uncertainties regarding the extent of improvement, as outcomes depend on individual skin condition, peel strength, and compliance with aftercare instructions. Follow-up treatments may be necessary to sustain results or manage new breakouts.\n\nInformed Consent and Photography\nI confirm that I have been informed about all relevant aspects of this treatment and that I fully comprehend this advice. This includes information regarding:\n- The reasons for undergoing a Salicylic Peel and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of undergoing a Salicylic Peel\n- The risks associated with declining a Salicylic Peel\n- Any risks specific to my personal health and skin\n- The anticipated benefits of the treatment\n- Potential drawbacks or disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the choice to have no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any follow-up care that might be necessary\n\nClinical Photographs and Videos: I authorize the capture of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these images will become a part of my confidential medical file and will be stored accordingly.\n\nI have been asked what details I require to make an informed choice and have had the chance to discuss my desired outcome thoroughly.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent document and understand it completely. I have been provided sufficient opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has emerged that alters my decision to undergo the procedure or to provide my consent. I hereby consent to the procedure. This document serves as the complete disclosure and replaces any prior verbal or written communications.\n\nAll deposits and booking fees are non-refundable unless otherwise agreed upon with the practitioner."
