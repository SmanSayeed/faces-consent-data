                        "paraphrased_disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form aims to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of an acne control facial. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your provider before proceeding.\n\nYou should allocate sufficient time to consider this treatment thoroughly, evaluating all your alternatives before making an informed decision. It is essential that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that occur to you at any stage of the process.\n\nAn acne control facial is a specialized procedure involving deep cleansing, steaming, exfoliation with salicylic acid or enzymes, gentle extractions, high-frequency current, medicated masks, and soothing serums to clear blocked pores, reduce swelling, eliminate bacteria, and help prevent future breakouts. It targets active acne, congestion, and excess oil for clearer skin.\n\nThe session lasts 60-90 minutes, often including LED therapy to calm redness. A course of 4-6 weekly sessions is recommended, followed by monthly maintenance. Due to factors such as acne severity, hormonal influences, skin type, and overall health, you acknowledge that there are no guarantees, warranties, or promises of satisfaction with your results.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for best results. I will be informed ahead of each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, there are risks and potential complications. It is important that you are aware of these before proceeding. I am aware of the following potential risks/complications:\n\nCommon side effects include temporary redness, purging (initial increase in breakouts), dryness, peeling from acids, mild discomfort during extractions, typically resolving in 3-7 days. Sun sensitivity necessitates strict sunscreen use.\n\nRare complications include infection from extractions, allergic reactions or chemical burns from active ingredients, scarring if skin is delicate, post-inflammatory dark spots, or irritation worsening cystic acne. Not recommended for severe inflammatory acne, retinoid use, or active infections.\n\nI understand that the treatment may involve risks of complication or injury from both known and unknown causes, and I voluntarily accept those risks. Before receiving treatment, I have been open in disclosing any condition that could affect this procedure.\n\nI confirm I have been provided with all relevant information regarding this treatment and fully comprehend it. This information includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking treatment and the results I desire\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential drawbacks\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form, understand it completely, have been given ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete and final disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
