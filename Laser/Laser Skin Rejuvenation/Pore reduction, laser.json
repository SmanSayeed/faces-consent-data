                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser pore reduction treatment. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nLaser pore reduction uses fractional non-ablative or picosecond lasers to target enlarged facial pores by stimulating collagen contraction around pore openings and improving skin thickness. Treatments create microthermal zones that remodel dermal structure, reducing pore visibility by 20-40% after 3-6 sessions spaced 4 weeks apart. Commonly used lasers include 1064nm picosecond with diffractive lens array or 1565nm fractional lasers.\n\nOptimal results seen in Fitzpatrick I-IV skin types with oily/combination skin and visible pores from photoaging or sebum excess. No complete pore elimination possible as pores serve natural functions; maintenance required. Temporary redness/sensitivity lasts up to 14 days post-treatment.\n\nI will be notified in advance of each session about the location and practitioner. I understand I may withdraw consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common side effects include temporary redness, mild swelling, dryness, flaking up to 14 days. Increased sun sensitivity requires strict SPF use.\n\nLess common: transient hyperpigmentation (Fitzpatrick IV-V), milia formation, prolonged erythema beyond 14 days.\n\nRare complications: burns, scarring, infection, textural irregularities. Allergic reactions to cooling/topical agents possible.\n\nI understand treatment involves risks from known/unknown causes and assume them. Full medical history disclosed including isotretinoin use within 12 months, recent sun exposure.\n\nI confirm advised of all relevant information including treatment reasons, risks (general/personal), expected benefits (20-40% pore size reduction), alternatives (topicals, chemical peels, microneedling), uncertainties, follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs/videos for confidential medical records.\n\nGoals discussed; questions answered satisfactorily. No new information affects decision. I consent to procedure. This supersedes prior information."
