                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser skin texture refinement treatment. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nSkin texture refinement uses fractional or ablative laser technology to smooth rough skin surface, minimize enlarged pores, reduce fine lines, and improve overall skin clarity. The laser creates controlled micro-injuries that stimulate collagen remodeling and epidermal turnover, revealing smoother texture over multiple sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart.\n\nTreatment effectiveness varies by skin type, texture severity, sun damage extent, and adherence to aftercare. Fitzpatrick skin types I-IV respond best; no guarantees of perfection as results develop gradually over 3-6 months. Post-treatment redness, peeling may persist up to 14 days.\n\nI will be notified in advance of each session about the location and practitioner. I understand I may withdraw consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common side effects include temporary redness, swelling, dryness, flaking, mild stinging up to 14 days. Increased sun sensitivity requires strict photoprotection.\n\nLess common: hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation (higher risk in darker skin), milia formation, prolonged erythema, acne flare.\n\nRare complications: burns, scarring, infection, herpes simplex reactivation. Allergic reactions to topical preparations possible.\n\nI understand treatment involves risks from known/unknown causes and assume them. Full medical history disclosed including recent tanning, retinoid use.\n\nI confirm advised of treatment reasons, risks (general/personal), benefits, alternatives/no treatment, uncertainties, success probability, follow-up requirements.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs/videos for confidential medical records.\n\nGoals discussed; questions answered satisfactorily. No new information affects decision. I consent to procedure. This supersedes prior information."
