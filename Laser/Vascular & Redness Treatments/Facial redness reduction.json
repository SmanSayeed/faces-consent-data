                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser facial redness reduction treatment. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nFacial redness reduction uses pulsed dye laser (595nm VBeam), KTP (532nm), Nd:YAG (1064nm), or IPL to target diffuse erythema, rosacea flushing, and telangiectasias on cheeks, nose, chin. Laser energy selectively coagulates superficial blood vessels causing resorption over 2-4 weeks. Typically 3-5 sessions spaced 4 weeks apart achieve 50-80% redness reduction; maintenance annually for rosacea.\n\nOptimal for Fitzpatrick I-IV; results last until new vessels develop from triggers (heat, alcohol, stress). Temporary purpura common with PDL (7-10 days); skin sensitivity up to 14 days. Combination with topicals (brimonidine, azelaic acid) enhances outcomes.\n\nI will be notified in advance of each session about the location and practitioner. Consent may be withdrawn anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: purpura/bruising (PDL), redness, swelling up to 14 days. Sun sensitivity requires SPF 50+.\n\nLess common: hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, textural changes.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, vessel recurrence. Allergic reactions to cooling gel possible.\n\nI understand rosacea redness controlled not cured; lifestyle modification required. Full history disclosed including autoimmune disease, recent isotretinoin.\n\nI confirm advice received: realistic expectations (50-80% improvement), maintenance required, alternatives (topicals, makeup camouflage).\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs/videos for confidential records.\n\nGoals discussed; questions answered satisfactorily. No new information affects decision. I consent to procedure. This supersedes prior information."
