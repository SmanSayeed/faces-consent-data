                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser treatment for rosacea. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nRosacea laser treatment uses pulsed dye laser (595nm VBeam), KTP (532nm), Nd:YAG (1064nm), or IPL to target diffuse facial erythema, telangiectasias, and flushing associated with erythematotelangiectatic rosacea. Laser energy coagulates abnormal superficial vessels while sparing surrounding tissue, reducing redness 50-75% after 3-5 sessions spaced 4 weeks apart. Maintenance treatments annually recommended as rosacea chronic/relapsing.\n\nOptimal for Fitzpatrick I-IV; results improve texture via collagen stimulation. Temporary purpura common (PDL resolves 7-10 days); skin sensitivity up to 14 days. Lifestyle modification (avoid triggers: heat, alcohol, spicy food) essential for sustained results.\n\nI will be notified in advance of each session about the location and practitioner. Consent may be withdrawn anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: purpura/bruising (PDL), swelling, redness up to 14 days. Sun sensitivity requires SPF 50+.\n\nLess common: hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, acneiform eruption.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, rosacea exacerbation. Contraindicated recent isotretinoin, photosensitizers.\n\nI understand rosacea managed not cured; requires ongoing trigger avoidance/topicals. Full history disclosed including autoimmune disease, ocular rosacea.\n\nI confirm advice received: realistic expectations (50-75% improvement), maintenance required, alternatives (topicals, oral antibiotics).\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs/videos for confidential records.\n\nGoals discussed; questions answered satisfactorily. No new information affects decision. I consent to procedure. This supersedes prior information."
