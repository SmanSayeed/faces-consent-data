                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser cherry angioma removal treatment. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nCherry angioma removal uses pulsed dye laser (595nm), Nd:YAG (1064nm), KTP (532nm), or IPL to target dilated capillary loops within benign vascular proliferations appearing as bright red papules on trunk, arms, legs. Laser energy coagulates vessels causing angioma involution within 1-2 weeks. Single treatment typically clears lesions <3mm; larger/multiple may require 2 sessions spaced 4 weeks apart.\n\nBenign lesions common after age 30; new angiomas develop naturally. Fitzpatrick I-VI safe; minimal scarring risk. Temporary crusting/scabbing resolves within 14 days; sun protection recommended during healing.\n\nI will be notified in advance of each session about the location and practitioner. Consent may be withdrawn anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: crusting, scabbing, redness up to 14 days. Bruising possible with PDL.\n\nLess common: hypopigmentation/hyperpigmentation, textural change.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, incomplete clearance, recurrence. Bleeding risk if traumatized pre-treatment.\n\nI understand lesions benign/cosmetic treatment only. Full history disclosed including bleeding disorders, anticoagulant use.\n\nI confirm advice received: single-session efficacy (90%+ clearance), permanent removal unless new develop, alternatives (cryotherapy, electrocautery, shave excision).\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs/videos for confidential records.\n\nGoals discussed; questions answered satisfactorily. No new information affects decision. I consent to procedure. This supersedes prior information."
