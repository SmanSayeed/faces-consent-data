                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser broken capillary removal treatment. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nLaser broken capillary removal uses pulsed dye laser (585-595nm), Nd:YAG (1064nm), or KTP (532nm) to target hemoglobin in telangiectasias, spider veins, and diffuse erythema on face, nose, cheeks. Laser energy coagulates vessel walls causing selective photothermolysis and resorption over 2-4 weeks. Typically 1-3 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart achieve 70-90% clearance.\n\nOptimal for Fitzpatrick I-IV; results permanent unless new vessels form from rosacea, sun damage, aging. Temporary purpura/bruising common with PDL; skin sensitivity up to 14 days. Multiple vessels may require combination vascular laser therapy.\n\nI will be notified in advance of each session about the location and practitioner. Consent may be withdrawn anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: purpura/bruising (PDL, 7-14 days), redness, swelling up to 14 days. Sun sensitivity requires SPF 50+.\n\nLess common: hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, blistering, crusting.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, vessel recurrence, paradoxical telangiectasia. Allergic reactions to cooling gel possible.\n\nI understand risks from known/unknown causes and assume them. Full history disclosed including rosacea, blood clotting disorders, recent isotretinoin.\n\nI confirm advice received: treatment reasons, risks/benefits (70-90% clearance), alternatives (sclerotherapy, topicals), maintenance sun protection.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs/videos for confidential records.\n\nGoals discussed; questions answered satisfactorily. No new information affects decision. I consent to procedure. This supersedes prior information."
