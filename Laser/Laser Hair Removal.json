                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser hair removal. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, evaluating all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is important you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nLaser hair removal is a cosmetic procedure that uses concentrated light energy to heat and disable unwanted hair follicles. Regular sessions are required to manage hair regrowth, as the results are not permanent. On average, facial hair treatments are scheduled every 4 weeks, while body hair treatments are typically spaced 6 to 8 weeks apart. A series of treatments is usually necessary to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nI understand that results vary between individuals and depend on many personal factors. I am aware there is no guarantee I will achieve my desired results and that multiple treatment courses are often needed to maintain results. It is also important to note that laser hair removal tends to be more effective on individuals with lighter skin tones and darker hair. I understand that for my own benefit, I must follow the aftercare instructions provided by my practitioner. During the procedure, you will be offered protective eyewear, and a cooling spray or gel may be applied to the skin beforehand.\n\nI understand that several appointments may be required for optimal results. I will be notified in advance of each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept informed of my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, there are potential risks and complications. Laser hair removal is generally considered safe and low-risk, but you must be aware of the following possibilities before proceeding. You must discuss any questions fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include discomfort during the procedure, often described as a sensation similar to a rubber band snapping against the skin. Following treatment, your skin may be red, swollen, and tender; these effects usually resolve within 48 hours but can last longer. Your skin will be more sensitive to sunlight after treatment, and you will need to use a high-SPF sunscreen regularly for at least 4 weeks afterward.\n\nLess common complications include skin infection (cellulitis) and changes in skin pigmentation, either lightening or darkening. Pigmentation changes often resolve within 6 months but can occasionally persist or become permanent. In some cases, clients may experience bruising, swelling, blistering, or crusting of the skin. If you notice any of these skin changes, you should contact your practitioner promptly.\n\nRare complications include skin scarring, which may be permanent in some cases despite treatment. Skin burns from the laser's heat can rarely occur and may lead to permanent scarring. There is no evidence that laser hair removal causes skin cancer.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and fully understand it. This advice includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking treatment and desired outcome\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of refusing the procedure\n- Any risks specific to me\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their pros and cons, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of success\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I require to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent, understand it fully, have had ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
