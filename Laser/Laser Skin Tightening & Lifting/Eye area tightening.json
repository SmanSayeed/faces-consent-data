                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form is designed to provide you with information about the possible advantages and risks associated with the eye area tightening procedure. Please read this material thoroughly and have a comprehensive discussion with your skincare professional before proceeding.\n\nYou should take all the time necessary to carefully consider the treatment, evaluating all your options before arriving at an informed decision. It is crucial that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\nEye area tightening is a non-surgical cosmetic treatment using fractional lasers (CO2, Erbium:YAG) or non-ablative lasers to firm delicate periorbital skin, reduce fine lines, crow's feet, puffiness, and mild hooding around eyelids and under eyes. The laser creates controlled microthermal zones that stimulate collagen/elastin production and contract skin fibers, improving texture and elasticity without cutting. The procedure involves thorough cleansing, topical numbing cream (45-60 minutes prior), protective corneal shields/eyewear, and precise laser passes around orbital rim, crow's feet, and lower eyelids, typically lasting 20-45 minutes.\n\nPatients feel warmth, prickling, or mild stinging during treatment despite numbing. Multiple sessions (2-4), spaced 4-6 weeks apart, yield gradual tightening visible over 1-3 months, lasting 1-2 years with maintenance. Best for mild-moderate laxity; severe cases need surgical consideration.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for the best outcome. I will be informed before each session about the location and the practitioner who will be overseeing my care. I also understand that I will be updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nAfter treatment, expect redness, swelling, crusting, or light sensitivity for 3-7 days (longer with ablative lasers). Avoid sun/UV exposure, makeup, contacts, swimming for 2 weeks; use prescribed ointments, cool compresses, gentle washing, and SPF 50+ around eyes. No rubbing eyes or sleeping face-down until healed.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any medical or cosmetic procedure, there are associated risks. It is important you are aware of these and discuss them fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include temporary redness, swelling, dryness, peeling, milia, or bruising around eyes, resolving in 5-14 days. Eyes may feel gritty or watery temporarily.\n\nLess common effects include prolonged swelling, hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation (higher risk in darker tones), prolonged erythema, or textural irregularities.\n\nRare complications involve corneal abrasion, eye infection, ectropion (lid eversion), scarring, herpes reactivation, or vision changes. Highest risks around thin eyelid skin; requires expert operator with eye protection.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and that I fully understand it. This advice covers:\n\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits of the treatment\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and drawbacks, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed choice and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form and understand it completely. I have been given sufficient time for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that changes my decision to undergo treatment or to give my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document represents the complete disclosure and replaces any prior discussions or written information."
