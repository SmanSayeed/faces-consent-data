                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form is designed to provide you with information about the possible advantages and risks associated with the body skin tightening procedure. Please read this material thoroughly and have a comprehensive discussion with your skincare professional before proceeding.\n\nYou should take all the time necessary to carefully consider the treatment, evaluating all your options before arriving at an informed decision. It is crucial that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\nBody skin tightening using laser is a non-surgical cosmetic treatment that targets loose, sagging skin on larger areas like abdomen, arms (bat wings), thighs, buttocks, or post-weight loss regions by heating dermal layers to stimulate collagen contraction and production. Non-ablative or fractional lasers deliver controlled thermal energy through the skin surface to remodel collagen/elastin without damaging the epidermis, gradually firming and smoothing contours. The procedure involves marking treatment zones, cleansing skin, applying numbing cream or cooling gel, protective eyewear, and systematic laser application over body areas, typically lasting 60-120 minutes depending on size.\n\nPatients may feel deep warming, tingling, or muscle-like contractions during treatment, managed with cooling bursts. Multiple sessions (4-8), spaced 4-6 weeks apart, produce cumulative tightening visible over 3-6 months, lasting 1-3 years with maintenance. Effective for mild-moderate laxity after pregnancy, weight loss, or aging; severe cases may need surgical options.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for the best outcome. I will be informed before each session about the location and the practitioner who will be overseeing my care. I also understand that I will be updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nAfter the procedure, expect redness, swelling, tenderness, or warmth for 2-5 days. Avoid sun exposure, hot tubs, saunas, heavy exercise, and tight clothing for 1-2 weeks; use gentle body washes, fragrance-free moisturizers, and broad-spectrum SPF 50+ on exposed areas. Hydrate well and wear compression garments if recommended.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any medical or cosmetic procedure, there are associated risks. It is important you are aware of these and discuss them fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include temporary redness, swelling, bruising, itching, dryness, or peeling across treated body areas, resolving within 1-2 weeks. Skin may feel tight or sensitive to touch.\n\nLess common effects include prolonged swelling, blistering, hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation (higher risk on body areas with sun exposure), or uneven tightening. Large area treatments risk more diffuse effects.\n\nRare complications involve burns, scarring, paradoxical fat loss, contour irregularities, infection, or allergic reactions to numbing agents. Risks increase with darker skin tones, recent tanning, photosensitive medications, smoking, or poor circulation.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and that I fully understand it. This advice covers:\n\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits of the treatment\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and drawbacks, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed choice and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form and understand it completely. I have been given sufficient time for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that changes my decision to undergo treatment or to give my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document represents the complete disclosure and replaces any prior discussions or written information."
