                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about the advantages and risks of laser lipolysis (laser-assisted liposuction). Read thoroughly and discuss with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nTake time to consider all options, seek second opinions, and ask questions. Laser lipolysis uses fiber-optic laser energy delivered through tiny incisions to liquefy targeted subcutaneous fat cells in areas like abdomen, thighs, arms, or chin, followed by gentle aspiration. Local anesthesia used; sessions last 30-90 minutes depending on areas treated. Promotes skin tightening via collagen stimulation; results visible in 1-3 months with final contour at 6 months. Not for weight loss or obesity; multiple sessions may be needed.\n\nWear compression garments 2-4 weeks post-treatment; avoid strenuous activity 1-2 weeks. Informed of practitioner each session; withdraw consent anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: swelling, bruising, tenderness, numbness (resolves 2-4 weeks). Less common: infection, seroma (fluid collection), uneven contours, skin burns, hyperpigmentation.\n\nRare: fat embolism, organ perforation, prolonged pain, paradoxical adipose hyperplasia. Contraindications: pregnancy, active infection, blood clotting disorders, uncontrolled diabetes, liver/heart disease, obesity BMI>30.\n\nI confirm understanding of procedure reasons, risks (including not treating), personal health risks, benefits, alternatives (traditional liposuction, CoolSculpting, diet/exercise), uncertainties, follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photos/videos for confidential records.\n\nI certify reading/understanding this form, questions answered satisfactorily, and consent to procedure."
