                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about skin tightening treatments following fat reduction procedures like liposuction or non-invasive fat loss. Read thoroughly and discuss with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nTake time to consider all options, seek second opinions, and ask questions. Post-fat reduction skin tightening uses radiofrequency (RF), ultrasound, infrared laser (SkinTyte), or fractional lasers to heat dermal layers, stimulating neocollagenesis and elastin remodeling for improved skin contraction. Non-invasive sessions last 30-60 minutes; typically 4-8 treatments spaced 1-2 weeks apart. Results gradual over 3-6 months; enhances natural skin retraction after volume loss.\n\nAvoid sun exposure 2 weeks pre/post (SPF 50+), maintain hydration, gentle skincare. Multiple sessions required; informed of practitioner each time, withdraw consent anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: temporary redness, warmth, mild swelling (resolves 24-48 hours). Less common: blistering, crusting, hyperpigmentation (darker skin higher risk).\n\nRare: burns, scarring, fat atrophy, suboptimal tightening. Contraindications: active infections, recent fillers (wait 4 weeks), pregnancy, pacemakers (RF/ultrasound), photosensitive medications.\n\nI confirm understanding of procedure reasons, risks (including not treating), personal health risks, benefits, alternatives (surgical lift, compression garments), uncertainties, follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photos/videos for confidential records.\n\nI certify reading/understanding this form, questions answered satisfactorily, and consent to procedure."
