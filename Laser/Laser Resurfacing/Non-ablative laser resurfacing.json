                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form is designed to provide you with information about the possible advantages and risks associated with the non-ablative laser resurfacing procedure. Please read this material thoroughly and have a comprehensive discussion with your skincare professional before proceeding.\n\nYou should take all the time necessary to carefully consider the treatment, evaluating all your options before arriving at an informed decision. It is crucial that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\nNon-ablative laser resurfacing uses gentler laser wavelengths (Nd:YAG, fractional non-ablative, diode) that penetrate skin without vaporizing the surface layer, instead heating deeper dermal layers to stimulate collagen production, elastin remodeling, and neocollagenesis for improved texture, fine lines, mild scars, and pigmentation. Unlike ablative lasers, the epidermis remains intact, allowing minimal downtime while gradually rejuvenating skin from within. The procedure involves skin cleansing, cooling gel application, protective eyewear, and multiple laser passes over face, neck, or body areas, typically lasting 30-60 minutes per session.\n\nPatients feel mild warmth, tingling, or prickling during treatment, often with integrated cooling for comfort—no numbing typically needed. Multiple sessions (3-6), spaced 4-6 weeks apart, produce cumulative improvements visible over 2-6 months as collagen matures, lasting 1-2 years. Suitable for all skin types with milder concerns; results more subtle than ablative but safer with less recovery.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for the best outcome. I will be informed before each session about the location and the practitioner who will be overseeing my care. I also understand that I will be updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nAfter treatment, mild redness, warmth, or swelling lasts 24-72 hours. Avoid sun exposure, heat sources, saunas, and retinoids for 1 week; use gentle skincare, moisturizers, and broad-spectrum SPF 50+ daily. Makeup usually resume next day; no peeling or crusting expected.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any medical or cosmetic procedure, there are associated risks. It is important you are aware of these and discuss them fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include temporary redness, swelling, mild tenderness, dryness, or flaking, resolving within hours to days. Skin may feel slightly tight.\n\nLess common effects include prolonged erythema, temporary hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation, milia, acne flares, or textural changes. Rare blistering or infection possible.\n\nRare complications involve burns, scarring, paradoxical worsening, eye injury without protection, or fat atrophy. Lower risk profile than ablative; safest for darker skin tones when proper settings used.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and that I fully understand it. This advice covers:\n\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits of the treatment\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and drawbacks, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed choice and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form and understand it completely. I have been given sufficient time for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that changes my decision to undergo treatment or to give my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document represents the complete disclosure and replaces any prior discussions or written information."
