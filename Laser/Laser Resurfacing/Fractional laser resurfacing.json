                        "disclaimer": "I am electing to receive Fractional CO2 Laser treatment and have been provided with the following details regarding the procedure:\n\nWhat is Fractional CO2 Laser Treatment?\n\nFractional CO2 Laser treatment is a form of laser skin resurfacing that employs a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser to generate microscopic thermal columns within the skin. This technique eliminates damaged skin cells and promotes the generation of new cells, leading to smoother, firmer, and more uniform skin tone.\n\nHow is the Procedure Conducted?\n\nDuring the Fractional CO2 Laser session, the physician or certified laser specialist will utilize a laser device to administer brief pulses of laser energy to the skin. This process will elevate skin temperature and remove the outermost layer, facilitating the formation of fresh skin tissue.\n\nIs Fractional CO2 Laser Treatment Safe?\n\nFractional CO2 Laser treatment is generally regarded as safe; however, similar to all medical interventions, certain risks exist. Potential risks and side effects may include, but are not limited to:\n•\tMild to moderate procedural discomfort\n•\tPost-procedural redness and swelling\n•\tSkin crusting or scab formation\n•\tItching or skin flaking\n•\tSkin discoloration or pigment changes\n•\tInfection or scarring\n\nThese procedural risks will be explored more comprehensively during your consultation with the physician or certified laser specialist.\nWhat to Anticipate During and After the Procedure?\n\nFractional CO2 Laser treatment will be performed with topical anesthetic cream to minimize discomfort. During the procedure, you may experience a warming or tingling sensation that may be uncomfortable but should not be painful.\n\nFollowing the procedure, you can anticipate some redness and swelling, resembling mild to moderate sunburn, which typically subsides within several days. Crusting or scabbing may also occur but generally resolves within 5-7 days.\n\nIt is crucial to avoid sun exposure for a minimum of two weeks after treatment and to use broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher. Refrain from using harsh skincare products, including alpha-hydroxy acids (AHA) and retinoids, for at least one week post-treatment.\n\nI have reviewed and comprehend the information presented above concerning Fractional CO2 Laser Treatment. I have had adequate opportunity to ask questions, and all my inquiries have been addressed to my satisfaction. I understand the potential risks and benefits of the procedure and have chosen to proceed with treatment voluntarily."
