                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about the advantages and risks of benign lesion removal using laser, cryotherapy, electrocautery, or excision methods. Read thoroughly and discuss with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nTake time to consider options, seek second opinions, and ask questions. Benign lesions (seborrheic keratoses, skin tags, milia, cherry angiomas) are removed via targeted destruction or excision to improve appearance or prevent irritation. Laser vaporizes superficial lesions; cryotherapy freezes; cautery burns; excision cuts out. Numbing applied; sessions 5-20 minutes. Most resolve in 1 session; deeper lesions may need follow-up.\n\nHealing takes 7-14 days (crusting falls off); sun protection (SPF 50+) 2-4 weeks pre/post, no picking. Informed of method/practitioner per session; withdraw consent anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: redness, swelling, scabbing, tenderness (1-2 weeks). Less common: hypopigmentation/hyperpigmentation (darker skin higher risk), blistering. Rare: infection, scarring (excision/poor healing), recurrence, allergic reaction to cryogen.\n\nContraindications: suspected malignancy (biopsy first), active infections, blood disorders, recent isotretinoin (6 months), keloid history.\n\nI confirm understanding of procedure reasons, risks (including not treating), personal health risks, benefits, alternatives (watchful waiting), uncertainties, follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photos/videos for confidential records.\n\nI certify reading/understanding this form, questions answered satisfactorily, and consent to procedure."
