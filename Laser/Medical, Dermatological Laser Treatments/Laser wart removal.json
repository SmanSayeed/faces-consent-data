                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about the advantages and risks of laser wart removal. Read thoroughly and discuss with your skincare professional before proceeding.\n\nTake time to consider all options, seek second opinions, and ask questions. Laser wart removal (CO2, pulsed dye, or Nd:YAG lasers) targets HPV-infected tissue, coagulating blood vessels and vaporizing wart cells precisely without damaging surrounding skin. Numbing cream applied first; sessions last 5-15 minutes. Most warts require 1-3 treatments spaced 3-4 weeks apart; recurrence possible if virus persists.\n\nImprovements visible within 1-2 weeks as crust falls off; protect area from sun (SPF 50+) 2 weeks pre/post, keep moisturized, no picking scabs. Multiple sessions may be needed; informed of practitioner/location each time, withdraw consent anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: pain (rubber band snap), redness, swelling, blistering, crusting resolving in 7-14 days. Less common: infection (poor aftercare), hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation (higher darker skin tones), temporary textural changes.\n\nRare: scarring (if improper settings), burns, bleeding, wart recurrence. Contraindications: active infections, photosensitive medications, recent isotretinoin (6 months), genital warts (specialized care), pregnancy.\n\nI confirm understanding of procedure reasons, risks (including not treating), personal health risks, benefits, alternatives (cryotherapy, salicylic acid, surgery), uncertainties, follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photos/videos for confidential records.\n\nI certify reading/understanding this form, questions answered satisfactorily, and consent to procedure."
