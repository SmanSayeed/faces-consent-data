                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about the advantages and risks of laser treatment for onychomycosis (nail fungus). Read thoroughly and discuss with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nTake time to consider all options, seek second opinions, and ask questions. Laser therapy (Nd:YAG, CO2, or diode lasers) penetrates the nail plate to target fungal elements in the nail bed/matrix through photothermal/photomechanical effects, without damaging surrounding tissue. No numbing needed; sessions last 10-30 minutes per foot. Typically 3-12 treatments spaced 1-4 weeks apart; new clear nail growth visible in 3-12 months. Complete mycological cure not guaranteed (~60-80% clinical improvement); recurrence possible.\n\nKeep nails trimmed short, feet dry, use antifungal powder post-treatment. Multiple sessions required; informed of practitioner each time, withdraw consent anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: mild warmth/discomfort during treatment, transient redness, swelling resolving within hours-days. Less common: temporary nail discoloration, pain, blistering, dry skin.\n\nRare: nail matrix damage (abnormal growth), burns, infection. Contraindications: photosensitive medications, active nail/skin infection, pregnancy/breastfeeding, melanoma history, pacemakers (some lasers), poor circulation.\n\nI confirm understanding of procedure reasons, risks (including not treating), personal health risks, benefits, alternatives (oral/topical antifungals), uncertainties, follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photos/videos for confidential records.\n\nI certify reading/understanding this form, questions answered satisfactorily, and consent to procedure."
