                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about the advantages and risks of lip blush tattoo removal using Q-switched or Pico laser technology. Read thoroughly and discuss with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nTake time to consider all options, seek second opinions, and ask questions. The procedure targets lip blush pigment (often containing titanium dioxide) with specific laser wavelengths (532nm reds, 1064nm darker inks), fragmenting particles via photothermolysis for immune system clearance. Topical numbing applied first; sessions 15-30 minutes, 4-10+ treatments spaced 6-8 weeks apart required. Complete removal not guaranteed; pigment may oxidize/turn dark initially, especially titanium-based inks; results vary by depth, color, skin type.\n\nExpect gradual fading; avoid sun 4 weeks pre/post (SPF 50+ lips), no picking blisters/scabs, cold compresses for swelling. Informed of practitioner/location per session; withdraw consent anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: pain (rubber band snap intensified on lips), redness, significant swelling (1-3 days), blistering, crusting, temporary darkening/lightening, cold sore reactivation. Less common: infection (poor aftercare), allergic reactions to fragmented pigments, hyper/hypopigmentation (higher in darker tones), pigment oxidation.\n\nRare: scarring, lip border blurring, prolonged sensitivity, textural changes. Contraindications: active herpes/cold sores, recent fillers (wait 4 weeks), Accutane (6 months), photosensitizing meds, active lip infections.\n\nI confirm understanding of procedure reasons, risks (including not treating), personal health risks, benefits, alternatives (saline removal), uncertainties, follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photos/videos for confidential records.\n\nI certify reading and understanding this form, questions answered, no new information changes decision, and consent to procedure."
