                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about laser removal of microblading, a semi-permanent eyebrow tattoo technique using fine hair strokes. Read thoroughly and discuss with your practitioner.\n\nConsider options carefully, seek second opinions, ask questions. Laser (Q-switched or Pico) targets pigment in the superficial dermal layer, fragmenting it for immune clearance; numbing applied first. Sessions 15-30 minutes, 4-10+ treatments 6-8 weeks apart; complete removal not guaranteed, varies by pigment (iron oxide may darken), skin type, age.\n\nGradual fading; avoid sun 4 weeks pre/post with SPF 50+, no makeup/picking scabs. Informed of practitioner/location per session, withdraw consent anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: pain (snap sensation), redness, swelling, blistering, crusting, scabbing, itching (1-2 weeks). Less common: infection (poor aftercare), hypersensitivity/allergic to pigments (mercury/cobalt/chromium), pigment oxidation (darkening gray/black), hyper/hypopigmentation (darker skin higher risk).\n\nRare: scarring, textural changes, hair follicle damage/thinning, eye irritation if unprotected. Contraindications: active infection, recent sun/Accutane (6 months), photosensitizers, keloid history.\n\nI understand procedure reasons, risks (of doing/not), personal risks, benefits, alternatives (saline, cover-up), uncertainties, follow-up.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: Authorize photos/videos for records.\n\nCertify read/understood form, questions answered, consent given."
