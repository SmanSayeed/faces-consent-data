                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about the advantages and risks of multi-colour laser tattoo removal. Read thoroughly and discuss with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nTake time to consider options, seek second opinions, and ask questions. Multi-colour tattoo removal uses lasers with multiple wavelengths (e.g., 1064 nm for black, 532 nm for red, 755 nm for green) to target different ink colors, breaking particles into fragments cleared by the immune system. Sessions last 10-30 minutes per area, with numbing cream applied first; multiple sessions (6-12+) spaced 6-8 weeks apart are needed, as results vary by ink depth, color, skin type, and tattoo age.\n\nImprovements appear gradually over months; complete removal isn't guaranteed, especially for multicolored or deep inks, and tattoos may fade unevenly. You'll be informed of practitioner and location per session, can withdraw consent anytime, and must avoid sun exposure 4 weeks before/after using high-SPF sunscreen.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common effects include pain (like rubber band snaps), redness, swelling, blistering, pinpoint bleeding, crusting resolving in 1-2 weeks. Less common: infection, allergic reactions to ink, hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation (higher risk in darker skin types 4-6), textural changes. Rare: scarring, color shifts in remaining ink.\n\nContraindications include recent sun tanning, Roaccutane use (within 6 months), photosensitizing meds, active skin infections, cancer history at site, iron/titanium inks.\n\nI confirm understanding of procedure reasons, risks (including not treating), personal health risks, benefits, alternatives (e.g., covering tattoo), uncertainties, and follow-up.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photos/videos for records.\n\nI certify reading and understanding this form, questions answered, and consent to procedure."
