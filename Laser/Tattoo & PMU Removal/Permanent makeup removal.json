                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about the advantages and risks of permanent makeup removal using laser technology (Q-switched, Pico, or Nd:YAG lasers). Read thoroughly and discuss with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nTake time to consider all options, seek second opinions, and ask questions. The laser targets pigment particles in eyebrows, lips, eyeliner, or other areas, shattering them into fragments cleared by the immune system via lymphatics. Topical numbing and cooling used; sessions last 10-40 minutes with 1-10+ treatments spaced 6-8 weeks apart. Complete removal not always guaranteed; depends on pigment type/color, depth, skin tone, age.\n\nGradual fading over weeks-months; avoid sun 4 weeks pre/post (SPF 50+), no makeup/picking scabs. Informed of practitioner/location per session; withdraw consent anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: discomfort (hot snap sensation), redness, swelling, blistering, crusting, scabbing, itching (resolves 1-2 weeks). Less common: infection, allergic reactions to ink fragments, hyper/hypopigmentation (higher darker skin risk), pigment darkening (iron oxide).\n\nRare: scarring, textural changes, hair loss (eyebrows rare with modern Pico lasers), eye irritation (eyeliner). Contraindications: active infections, recent Accutane (6 months), photosensitizers, pregnancy, keloid tendency.\n\nI confirm understanding of procedure reasons, risks (of doing/not), personal health risks, benefits, alternatives (saline), uncertainties, follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photos/videos for confidential records.\n\nI certify reading/understanding this form, questions answered satisfactorily, and consent to procedure."
