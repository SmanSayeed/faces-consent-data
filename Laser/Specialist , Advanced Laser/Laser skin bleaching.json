                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about the advantages and risks of laser skin bleaching/lightening using Q-switched Nd:YAG, Pico, or fractional lasers. Read thoroughly and discuss with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nTake time to consider all options, seek second opinions, and ask questions. The laser targets excess melanin in the epidermis/dermis through selective photothermolysis, breaking down pigment granules for immune clearance without affecting normal skin. Topical numbing applied; sessions last 15-30 minutes for face/body areas. Typically 4-8 treatments spaced 2-4 weeks apart; gradual lightening visible over 1-3 months.\n\nStrict sun protection (SPF 50+ broad spectrum) mandatory 2 weeks pre/post; avoid hydroquinone/retinols during series. Multiple sessions required; informed of practitioner each time, withdraw consent anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: redness, warmth, mild swelling (resolves 24-72 hours). Less common: post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH, higher Fitzpatrick IV-VI), temporary hypopigmentation.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, infection, paradoxical darkening, blistering. Contraindications: active skin infections, recent isotretinoin (6-12 months), photosensitive medications/disorders, pregnancy, keloid history.\n\nI confirm understanding of procedure reasons, risks (including not treating), personal health risks, benefits, alternatives (chemical peels, topicals, IPL), uncertainties, follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photos/videos for confidential records.\n\nI certify reading/understanding this form, questions answered satisfactorily, and consent to procedure."
