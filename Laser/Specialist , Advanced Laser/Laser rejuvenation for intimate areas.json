                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about the advantages and risks of laser skin rejuvenation for intimate areas (vulva, perianal, inner labia) using fractional CO2, Erbium, or non-ablative lasers. Read thoroughly and discuss with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nTake time to consider all options, seek second opinions, and ask questions. The laser delivers controlled thermal energy to stimulate collagen remodeling, improve skin texture/elasticity, reduce pigmentation, and enhance tightness without surgery. Topical numbing applied; sessions last 15-30 minutes. Typically 3-5 treatments spaced 4-6 weeks apart; improvements visible at 1-3 months with continued enhancement up to 6 months.\n\nExpect mild swelling/redness 2-5 days; avoid intercourse, tampons, hot baths 5-7 days post-treatment. Strict hygiene essential; informed of practitioner each session, withdraw consent anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: discomfort, redness, swelling, sensitivity (resolves 3-7 days). Less common: prolonged tenderness, hyperpigmentation, dryness, yeast infection flare.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, infection, herpes reactivation, dyspareunia (painful intercourse), permanent sensation changes. Contraindications: active infections (UTI, herpes, bacterial vaginosis), pregnancy/breastfeeding, recent childbirth (wait 6 months), keloid history, photosensitive medications.\n\nI confirm understanding of procedure reasons, risks (including not treating), personal health risks, benefits, alternatives (topicals, PRP), uncertainties, follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photos/videos for confidential records.\n\nI certify reading/understanding this form, questions answered satisfactorily, and consent to procedure."
