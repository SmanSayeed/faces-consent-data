                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser sun spot treatment. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nLaser sun spot treatment uses Q-switched Nd:YAG, IPL, picosecond, or fractional lasers to target melanin in solar lentigines (sunspots) on face, hands, chest, arms from chronic UV exposure. The laser selectively photothermolyses pigment granules for natural clearance by macrophages within 7-14 days. Typically 1-3 sessions spaced 3-4 weeks apart achieve 70-95% clearance.\n\nBest results in Fitzpatrick I-III skin types; darker skin carries higher PIH risk requiring test spots. Temporary darkening/crusting precedes fading; new spots develop without sun protection. Skin sensitivity lasts up to 14 days post-treatment.\n\nI will be notified in advance of each session about the location and practitioner. Consent may be withdrawn anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: redness, swelling, crusting, temporary pigment darkening up to 14 days. Strict sun avoidance essential.\n\nLess common: hypopigmentation, blistering, textural changes, incomplete clearance.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, paradoxical hyperpigmentation, infection. Allergic reactions to topicals possible.\n\nI understand risks from known/unknown causes and assume them. Full history disclosed including hormonal pigmentation, recent tanning, photosensitizers.\n\nI confirm advice received: treatment reasons, risks/benefits (70-95% clearance), alternatives (cryotherapy, topicals, chemical peels), uncertainties, follow-up sun protection.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs/videos for confidential records.\n\nGoals discussed; questions answered satisfactorily. No new information affects decision. I consent to procedure. This supersedes prior information."
