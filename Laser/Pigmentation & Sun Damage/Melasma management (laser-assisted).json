                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser-assisted melasma management. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nLaser-assisted melasma management uses low-fluence Q-switched Nd:YAG (1064nm), picosecond lasers, or fractional non-ablative lasers combined with topical lightening agents (hydroquinone 4%, tretinoin, tranexamic acid) to reduce epidermal/dermal/mixed melasma on cheeks, forehead, upper lip. Laser settings minimize heat damage while stimulating pigment clearance and collagen remodeling. Requires 6-12 sessions spaced 2-4 weeks apart plus strict daily sun protection/oral tranexamic acid for maintenance.\n\nHigh recurrence risk (40-60% within 6 months) without ongoing prevention. Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin types require test spots due to PIH risk. Expect gradual lightening over 3-6 months; complete clearance rare. Post-treatment sensitivity up to 14 days.\n\nI will be notified in advance of each session about the location and practitioner. Consent may be withdrawn anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: temporary redness, sensitivity, dryness, mild crusting up to 14 days. Strict SPF 50+ mandatory.\n\nLess common: post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (20-40% risk), hypopigmentation, irritation from topicals.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, melasma rebound darkening. Photosensitizing medications contraindicated.\n\nI understand elevated recurrence risks and need for lifelong sun avoidance/topicals. Full history disclosed including hormonal triggers, pregnancy history, OCP use.\n\nI confirm advice received: treatment adjunctive to topicals/sun protection, realistic expectations (50-70% improvement), alternatives (topicals alone, chemical peels), high recurrence risk, indefinite maintenance required.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs/videos for confidential records.\n\nGoals discussed; questions answered satisfactorily. No new information affects decision. I consent to procedure. This supersedes prior information."
