                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser uneven skin tone correction treatment. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nUneven skin tone correction uses IPL, fractional lasers, picosecond lasers, or Q-switched Nd:YAG to address mixed hyperpigmentation including sunspots, melasma, PIH, redness, and sallowness across face, neck, chest. Treatment targets melanin clusters, vascular components, and stimulates uniform epidermal renewal. Typically 4-6 sessions spaced 3-4 weeks apart combined with medical-grade topicals achieve 60-80% improvement.\n\nResults vary by pigmentation type/depth, skin type, sun exposure compliance. Fitzpatrick IV-VI require conservative settings/test spots. Maintenance essential as recurrence common without SPF 50+/antioxidants. Post-treatment sensitivity lasts up to 14 days.\n\nI will be notified in advance of each session about the location and practitioner. Consent may be withdrawn anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: temporary redness, darkening of pigment (resolves 7-14 days), flaking, sun sensitivity. Strict photoprotection mandatory.\n\nLess common: PIH (10-25% Fitzpatrick IV+), hypopigmentation, prolonged erythema.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, textural irregularities, color mismatch. Allergic reactions to topicals possible.\n\nI understand mixed pigmentation responds variably and requires combination therapy. Full history disclosed including hormonal factors, recent peels/lasers.\n\nI confirm advice received: realistic expectations (60-80% improvement), adjunctive topicals/sun protection required, alternatives (chemical peels, topicals alone), maintenance therapy needed.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs/videos for confidential records.\n\nGoals discussed; questions answered satisfactorily. No new information affects decision. I consent to procedure. This supersedes prior information."
