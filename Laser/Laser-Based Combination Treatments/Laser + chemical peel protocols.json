                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document provides information regarding the benefits and potential risks of combined laser and chemical peel treatments for skin rejuvenation. Please read this material thoroughly and discuss it with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nTake adequate time to evaluate all options, consider second opinions, and ask any questions. Sequential or simultaneous protocols typically involve light-to-medium TCA or Jessner's peels followed by non-ablative fractional lasers (such as Fraxel or Clear+Brilliant), or the reverse sequence. This combined approach addresses pigmentation, texture, fine lines, and acne scarring through synergistic exfoliation and collagen stimulation. Topical anesthetic is applied, and sessions typically last 45-90 minutes. Usually 3-6 treatments are spaced 4-6 weeks apart; performing a peel first may allow the laser to penetrate more deeply, while peels can prepare the skin for enhanced laser efficacy.\n\nExpect redness and peeling for 5-10 days post-treatment; avoid sun exposure for 2 weeks before and after (SPF 50+ is essential), discontinue retinoids 7 days prior, and use gentle skincare post-procedure. Multiple sessions are necessary; you will be informed of the practitioner for each session and may withdraw consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POTENTIAL REACTIONS: Common side effects include prolonged redness, peeling, crusting, and skin sensitivity (lasting 7-14 days). Less common reactions include post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (higher risk for Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI), irritation, and milia formation.\n\nRare complications may involve chemical or thermal burns, scarring, infection, demarcation lines, or herpes simplex reactivation. Contraindications include active infections or acne, recent isotretinoin use (within 6-12 months), history of keloid scarring, pregnancy, Roaccutane use within the past 12 months, and blood thinner medications.\n\nI confirm that I understand the reasons for the procedure, the risks (including those of not undergoing treatment), any personal health risks, expected benefits, alternative options (such as single-modality treatments), uncertainties, and necessary follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the capture of clinical photographs and videos for inclusion in my confidential medical records.\n\nI certify that I have read and understood this form, all my questions have been answered satisfactorily, and I consent to the procedure."
