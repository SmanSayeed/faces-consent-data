                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form provides information about the advantages and risks of combined laser treatment with skin boosters (hyaluronic acid, polynucleotides, or peptide-based injectables). Read thoroughly and discuss with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nTake time to consider all options, seek second opinions, and ask questions. The protocol typically involves laser treatment (Pico, fractional non-ablative, or laser toning) followed immediately or 1-2 weeks later by skin booster microinjections to enhance hydration, reduce laser-induced inflammation, and amplify collagen stimulation for superior texture, tone, and glow. Numbing cream and skin cleansing first; sessions last 45-75 minutes. Typically 3-4 combined treatments spaced 3-4 weeks apart; optimal results at 2-4 months.\n\nMild redness/swelling from laser plus small injection bumps expected 2-5 days; avoid sun exposure 1 week pre/post (SPF 50+ mandatory), no makeup 24-48 hours, gentle hydration post-care. Multiple sessions required; informed of practitioner each session, withdraw consent anytime.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: temporary redness, swelling, bruising at injection sites, dryness (3-7 days). Less common: post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, milia, vascular occlusion (rare with superficial boosters).\n\nRare: infection, allergic reaction, granulomas, herpes reactivation. Contraindications: active skin infections, recent fillers (wait 2 weeks), pregnancy/breastfeeding, autoimmune disorders, blood thinners, keloid history.\n\nI confirm understanding of procedure reasons, risks (including not treating), personal health risks, benefits, alternatives (separate treatments), uncertainties, follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photos/videos for confidential records.\n\nI certify reading/understanding this form, questions answered satisfactorily, and consent to procedure."
