                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form aims to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser treatment for ingrown hair reduction. Please read this information attentively and discuss any questions fully with your provider before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the necessary time to consider this treatment carefully, weighing all your alternatives before making an informed decision. It is essential that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that occur to you at any stage of the process.\n\nLaser ingrown hair reduction employs targeted light energy to destroy hair follicles that are prone to producing ingrown hairs, preventing hairs from regrowing and curling back into the skin. Effective for areas such as the bikini line, legs, face, and beard where pseudofolliculitis (razor bumps) or ingrown hairs frequently occur. Multiple sessions (6-8) are needed as the laser targets follicles in the active growth phase; this reduces both existing inflammation and future occurrences.\n\nMost effective for coarse or curly dark hair; studies indicate approximately 75% significant reduction after 3 sessions. No guarantees can be given as hormonal factors and skin type affect outcomes. Skin sensitivity may persist for up to 14 days post-treatment; avoid shaving between sessions.\n\nI will be informed of each session's practitioner and location. I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: temporary redness, swelling, mild discomfort, heightened sensitivity to sunlight for up to 14 days. Existing ingrown hairs may shed during treatment.\n\nLess common: blistering, crusting, temporary pigment changes (higher risk in treated areas with ingrowns), folliculitis flare-up.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, infection, paradoxical hypertrichosis (increased hair growth). Allergic reactions to topical agents are possible.\n\nI understand risks from both known and unknown causes and I accept them. I have disclosed my full history of reactions to shaving or waxing.\n\nI confirm I have been provided with advice regarding the reasons for treatment, risks (general and personal), benefits, alternatives including no treatment, uncertainties, probability of success (up to 90% reduction), and follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs and videos to be taken for my confidential medical records.\n\nI have discussed my objectives; all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information influences my decision. I consent to this procedure. This document supersedes any previous information."
