                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form aims to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser beard shaping. Please read this information attentively and discuss any questions fully with your provider before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the necessary time to consider this treatment carefully, weighing all your alternatives before making an informed decision. It is essential that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that occur to you at any stage of the process.\n\nLaser beard shaping employs targeted laser energy to precisely remove or reduce unwanted facial hair, sculpting the beard line for a well-defined shape. The procedure focuses on melanin in hair follicles in areas such as cheeks, neckline, sideburns, or jawline to achieve the desired beard contours. Multiple sessions are generally needed because hair grows in cycles.\n\nMost effective for darker hair on lighter skin; results vary based on hair and skin type, hormonal factors, medications. No guarantees of permanent results due to potential regrowth. Treatments are spaced 4-8 weeks apart; skin sensitivity may persist for up to 14 days after the procedure.\n\nI will be informed of each session's practitioner and location. I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common: temporary redness, swelling, mild discomfort (similar to a rubber band snap), heightened sensitivity to sunlight for up to 14 days.\n\nLess common: blistering, crusting, temporary pigment changes (darkening or lightening of the skin) which may last longer or, rarely, become permanent. Facial treatments require proper eye protection.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, infection, paradoxical hypertrichosis (increased hair growth in the treated area). Allergic reactions to cooling or topical agents are possible.\n\nI understand risks from both known and unknown causes and I accept them. I have disclosed my complete medical history.\n\nI confirm I have been provided with advice regarding the reasons for treatment, risks (general and personal), benefits, alternatives including no treatment, uncertainties, probability of success, and follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs and videos to be taken for my confidential medical records.\n\nI have discussed my objectives; all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information influences my decision. I consent to this procedure. This document supersedes any previous information."
