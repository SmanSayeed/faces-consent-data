                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form aims to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of laser hair reduction. Please read this information attentively and discuss any questions fully with your provider before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the necessary time to consider this treatment carefully, weighing all your alternatives before making an informed decision. It is essential that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that occur to you at any stage of the process.\n\nLaser hair reduction uses concentrated light energy to target the melanin in hair follicles, decreasing hair growth gradually. The procedure impairs the follicle to hinder future hair production and is effective for both facial and body areas. Multiple sessions are necessary because hair grows in cycles, with treatment focusing only on hairs in the active growth phase.\n\nOutcomes depend on skin type, hair color, thickness, hormonal factors, medications, and compliance with aftercare instructions. Dark hair on light skin tends to respond best; light or gray hair responds less effectively. No promises of complete or permanent reduction can be made due to individual variations.\n\nSeveral treatments at 4-8 week intervals may be required. Skin sensitivity following treatment can persist for up to 14 days. I will be informed of each session's details and the practitioner involved. I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Common effects include redness, swelling, mild discomfort (similar to a rubber band snap), sensitivity to sunlight for up to 14 days. Skin may feel tender or resemble mild sunburn.\n\nLess common: temporary pigment changes (darker or lighter patches), blistering, crusting, which may last longer or, rarely, become permanent. Risk of eye injury if not properly protected.\n\nRare: burns, scarring, infection, increased hair growth in the treated area (paradoxical hypertrichosis). Allergic reactions to topical cooling agents are possible.\n\nI understand risks from both known and unknown causes and I accept them. I have disclosed my complete medical history.\n\nI confirm I have been provided with advice regarding the reasons for treatment, risks (general and personal), benefits, alternatives including no treatment, uncertainties, likelihood of success, and follow-up care.\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize clinical photographs and videos to be taken for my confidential medical records.\n\nI have discussed my objectives; all my questions have been answered satisfactorily. No new information affects my decision. I consent to this procedure. This document supersedes any previous information."
