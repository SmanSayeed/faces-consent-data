                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form is designed to provide you with information about the possible advantages and risks associated with the post-acne redness treatment procedure. Please read this material thoroughly and have a comprehensive discussion with your skincare professional before proceeding.\n\nYou should take all the time necessary to carefully consider the treatment, evaluating all your options before arriving at an informed decision. It is crucial that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\nPost-acne redness treatment targets post-inflammatory erythema (PIE), the persistent red or pink marks left after acne healing, caused by dilated blood vessels and inflammation in lighter skin types. Treatments like pulsed dye laser (PDL), vascular lasers, or intense pulsed light (IPL) selectively heat and collapse these superficial blood vessels to fade redness and even skin tone. The procedure involves cleansing the skin, applying protective eyewear, and delivering targeted light energy pulses, typically lasting 15-30 minutes per session.\n\nYou may feel a warming or snapping sensation during treatment, with numbing cream optional for comfort. Multiple sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart are usually needed, with visible fading starting 2-4 weeks after each treatment and optimal results after 3-6 months. Individual response varies based on skin type, redness severity, and sun avoidance; maintenance may be required.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for the best outcome. I will be informed before each session about the location and the practitioner who will be overseeing my care. I also understand that I will be updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nAfter treatment, avoid sun exposure, tanning, saunas, and irritants until bruising or redness resolves (usually 3-7 days). Use gentle skincare, prescribed topicals, and broad-spectrum SPF 50+ sunscreen daily to protect healing skin and prevent worsening.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any medical or cosmetic procedure, there are associated risks. It is important you are aware of these and discuss them fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include temporary redness, swelling, warmth, purpura (bruising), or crusting in treated areas, resolving within days to a week. The skin may feel sensitive or appear darker temporarily.\n\nLess common effects include prolonged bruising, blistering, scabbing, hyperpigmentation, or hypopigmentation, particularly in darker skin tones. There is a small risk of burns, infection, scarring, or reactivation of cold sores (herpes simplex).\n\nRare complications involve textural changes, paradoxical worsening of redness, or eye injury if protection fails. Risks increase with recent tanning, photosensitizing medications (e.g., retinoids, antibiotics), or non-compliance with aftercare.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and that I fully understand it. This advice covers:\n\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits of the treatment\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and drawbacks, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed choice and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form and understand it completely. I have been given sufficient time for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that changes my decision to undergo treatment or to give my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document represents the complete disclosure and replaces any prior discussions or written information."
