                        "disclaimer": "Treatment Overview\n\nLaser acne treatment is a medical procedure that utilizes specific light wavelengths to target bacteria that contribute to acne. It also works to reduce inflammation and help prevent new breakouts. The treatment involves applying focused light energy to the skin.\n\nTreatment Process\n\nThe procedure will follow these key stages:\n\nInitial Skin Evaluation:\n\nA comprehensive skin assessment will be conducted to determine acne severity, skin type, and any factors that might affect treatment suitability. This ensures the laser approach is appropriate for your skin condition.\n\nSkin Preparation:\n\nThe treatment area will be thoroughly cleansed to remove surface impurities, oils, and cosmetics, ensuring optimal treatment effectiveness.\n\nLight Application:\n\nA cooling gel or topical agent may be applied to enhance comfort during the procedure.\nThe laser device will deliver controlled light energy to targeted skin areas. Most clients experience minimal discomfort, though some may notice a warm, tingling sensation.\n\nPost-Treatment Guidance:\n\nSoothing products may be applied after treatment to minimize redness or irritation. You may receive a specialized cream or ointment to help calm the skin.\nDetailed aftercare instructions will be provided, covering proper skin care following the procedure.\n\nAdditional Sessions:\n\nDepending on acne severity, multiple treatment sessions may be recommended. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled based on your skin's response and initial results.\n\nI confirm that I have been informed about all relevant aspects of this treatment and fully understand this information. This includes comprehensive details regarding:\n\n- the objectives and desired outcomes of this procedure\n- potential risks associated with undergoing the treatment\n- potential risks associated with declining treatment\n- risks specific to my individual circumstances\n- expected benefits of the treatment\n- possible disadvantages or limitations\n- alternative treatment options and their advantages/disadvantages - including the option of no treatment\n- any uncertainties and the likelihood of treatment success\n- any additional treatments that may be necessary\n\nMEDICAL PHOTOGRAPHY: I consent to the capture of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these images will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been consulted about the information I require to make an informed decision. I have had adequate opportunity to discuss my expectations to ensure my decision is well-informed.\n\nI certify that I have read and fully comprehend this consent information. I have been given sufficient opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered satisfactorily. No new information has emerged that alters my decision to proceed with treatment or provide consent. I hereby authorize this procedure. This document represents complete disclosure and replaces any previous verbal or written communications.\n\nAll deposits and booking fees are non-refundable unless specifically agreed upon with the practitioner."
