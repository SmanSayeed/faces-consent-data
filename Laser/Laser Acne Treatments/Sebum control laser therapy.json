                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form is designed to provide you with information about the possible advantages and risks associated with the sebum control laser therapy procedure. Please read this material thoroughly and have a comprehensive discussion with your skincare professional before proceeding.\n\nYou should take all the time necessary to carefully consider the treatment, evaluating all your options before arriving at an informed decision. It is crucial that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\nSebum control laser therapy is a cosmetic skin treatment designed to target overactive sebaceous (oil) glands to reduce excess sebum production, helping to manage oily skin and prevent acne breakouts. Specialized lasers penetrate the skin to selectively heat and shrink sebaceous glands, decreasing oil output while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. The procedure typically involves skin cleansing, protective eyewear, and precise laser application over the treatment areas, lasting 15-45 minutes depending on the size of the area.\n\nPatients may experience mild warmth, tingling, or a rubber band snapping sensation during treatment. Multiple sessions, usually spaced 4-6 weeks apart, are often recommended for optimal results, with improvements in oiliness and skin clarity visible over weeks to months. Results vary by individual, and maintenance treatments may be needed as sebaceous glands can gradually regain activity.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for the best outcome. I will be informed before each session about the location and the practitioner who will be overseeing my care. I also understand that I will be updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nAfter the procedure, avoid direct sun exposure, tanning beds, saunas, and extreme heat until any redness or sensitivity resolves. Use gentle cleansers, moisturizers, and broad-spectrum sunscreen as directed to support healing.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any medical or cosmetic procedure, there are associated risks. It is important you are aware of these and discuss them fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include temporary redness, swelling, warmth, dryness, or mild tenderness in the treated area, typically resolving within hours to a few days. The skin may feel tighter or more sensitive temporarily.\n\nLess common effects can include flaking, crusting, bruising, prolonged dryness, or changes in skin pigmentation (hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation), particularly in darker skin types. There is a small risk of burns, blistering, infection, or reactivation of herpes simplex (cold sores).\n\nRare complications include scarring, worsening acne or oiliness initially, or permanent pigment changes. Risks increase with recent sun exposure, certain medications (like photosensitizing drugs), or non-compliance with aftercare.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and that I fully understand it. This advice covers:\n\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits of the treatment\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and drawbacks, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed choice and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form and understand it completely. I have been given sufficient time for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that changes my decision to undergo treatment or to give my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document represents the complete disclosure and replaces any prior discussions or written information."
