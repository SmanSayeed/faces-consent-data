                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form is designed to provide you with information about the possible advantages and risks associated with the laser-assisted keloid scar management procedure. Please read this material thoroughly and have a comprehensive discussion with your skincare professional before proceeding.\n\nYou should take all the time necessary to carefully consider the treatment, evaluating all your options before arriving at an informed decision. It is crucial that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\nLaser-assisted keloid scar management uses targeted lasers such as pulsed dye laser (PDL), fractional CO2, or Nd:YAG, often combined with steroid injections or other therapies, to flatten raised keloid scars, reduce redness, itching, pain, and improve texture. Lasers selectively heat abnormal collagen bundles and blood vessels while sparing surrounding tissue, promoting remodeling and preventing recurrence. The procedure involves cleansing, numbing if needed, protective eyewear, laser application (surface or deeper penetration), and possible intralesional injections, typically lasting 30-60 minutes depending on lesion size.\n\nYou may feel stinging, warmth, or pressure during treatment. Multiple sessions (4-10), spaced 4-6 weeks apart, are usually required, often with adjuvant therapies. Improvements appear gradually over 3-12 months; keloids have high recurrence rates even with treatment, so ongoing maintenance may be needed. Results vary by keloid size, location, skin type, and treatment compliance.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for the best outcome. I will be informed before each session about the location and the practitioner who will be overseeing my care. I also understand that I will be updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nAfter treatment, expect swelling, redness, crusting, or bruising lasting 3-10 days. Avoid sun exposure, tanning, heat sources, and irritants for 4 weeks; use prescribed steroids, silicone sheets, gentle cleansing, and SPF 50+ sunscreen. No picking at crusts; pressure therapy or garments may be recommended.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any medical or cosmetic procedure, there are associated risks. It is important you are aware of these and discuss them fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include temporary redness, swelling, pain, itching, blistering, crusting, or hypopigmentation/hyperpigmentation, resolving over 1-4 weeks. Skin may feel tight or sensitive.\n\nLess common effects include infection, prolonged swelling, atrophy (thinning), telangiectasia (visible vessels), or keloid reactivation/growth. Lasers increase recurrence risk if used alone without steroids or adjuncts.\n\nRare complications involve burns, permanent pigment loss, new keloid formation, ulceration, or eye injury. Higher risks in darker skin types, large/old keloids, tension areas, or with photosensitizing medications/smoking.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and that I fully understand it. This advice covers:\n\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits of the treatment\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and drawbacks, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed choice and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form and understand it completely. I have been given sufficient time for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that changes my decision to undergo treatment or to give my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document represents the complete disclosure and replaces any prior discussions or written information."
