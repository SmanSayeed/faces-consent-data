                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form is designed to provide you with information about the possible advantages and risks associated with the surgical scar treatment procedure. Please read this material thoroughly and have a comprehensive discussion with your skincare professional before proceeding.\n\nYou should take all the time necessary to carefully consider the treatment, evaluating all your options before arriving at an informed decision. It is crucial that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\nSurgical scar treatment involves techniques to improve the appearance, texture, and function of scars resulting from surgery, injury, or burns. Methods include scar revision surgery (excision and re-closure with techniques like Z-plasty or W-plasty), laser resurfacing, steroid injections for raised scars, microneedling, silicone therapy, or combined approaches. The procedure begins with local anesthesia, thorough scar assessment, and precise tissue manipulation to realign or resurface the area, typically lasting 30-90 minutes depending on scar complexity.\n\nYou may experience pressure, tugging, or mild discomfort during treatment. Recovery varies: minor revisions heal in 7-14 days with sutures removal; more extensive work involves 2-4 weeks of swelling/bruising. Multiple treatments or follow-up therapies are often needed, with visible improvements over 3-12 months. Outcomes depend on scar age, location, skin type, and aftercare; complete erasure cannot be guaranteed.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for the best outcome. I will be informed before each session about the location and the practitioner who will be overseeing my care. I also understand that I will be updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nAfter the procedure, keep the area clean/dry, apply prescribed ointments, avoid stretching the scar, and protect from sun exposure with clothing or SPF 50+. No makeup, swimming, or strenuous activity until cleared. Raised scars may require pressure garments or silicone sheets; follow all aftercare to optimize healing.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any medical or cosmetic procedure, there are associated risks. It is important you are aware of these and discuss them fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include swelling, bruising, redness, tenderness, itching, or stiffness at the site, resolving over 1-3 weeks. The scar may initially appear worse (stretched/widened) before maturing.\n\nLess common effects include infection, delayed healing, bleeding/hematoma, allergic reactions to materials, or wound dehiscence (reopening). Pigment changes, prolonged numbness, or contour irregularities may occur.\n\nRare complications include recurrence of keloid/hypertrophic scarring, nerve damage, unsatisfactory cosmetic results requiring further surgery, or anesthesia-related issues. Risks increase with smoking, diabetes, poor nutrition, infection history, or tension across the scar.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and that I fully understand it. This advice covers:\n\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits of the treatment\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and drawbacks, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed choice and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form and understand it completely. I have been given sufficient time for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that changes my decision to undergo treatment or to give my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document represents the complete disclosure and replaces any prior discussions or written information."
