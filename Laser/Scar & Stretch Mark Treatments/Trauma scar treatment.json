                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form is designed to provide you with information about the possible advantages and risks associated with the trauma scar treatment procedure. Please read this material thoroughly and have a comprehensive discussion with your skincare professional before proceeding.\n\nYou should take all the time necessary to carefully consider the treatment, evaluating all your options before arriving at an informed decision. It is crucial that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\nTrauma scar treatment addresses scars from injuries, burns, or accidents using methods like laser resurfacing, microneedling, steroid injections, silicone therapy, manual therapy (massage, cupping), or surgical revision. These approaches remodel collagen, soften tissue, reduce discoloration, and improve flexibility/mobility. The procedure involves skin assessment, local anesthesia if needed, targeted application (laser passes, needle punctures, or injections), typically lasting 30-90 minutes based on scar extent.\n\nSensations may include warmth, stinging, pressure, or mild pain during treatment. Recovery varies: lasers cause 3-14 days redness/peeling; injections have minimal downtime; manual therapy allows immediate activity. Multiple sessions (3-6) spaced weeks apart yield gradual improvement over 3-12 months. Results depend on scar maturity, depth, location, and skin type; full elimination cannot be guaranteed.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for the best outcome. I will be informed before each session about the location and the practitioner who will be overseeing my care. I also understand that I will be updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nAfter treatment, protect scars from sun (SPF 50+, clothing), keep clean/moisturized, avoid stretching/picking, and follow prescribed care (silicone sheets, ointments). Limit heat, swimming, makeup until healed. Manual pressure or garments may be recommended for raised scars.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any medical or cosmetic procedure, there are associated risks. It is important you are aware of these and discuss them fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include redness, swelling, bruising, tenderness, itching, dryness, or flaking, resolving in days to weeks. Temporary worsening of scar appearance may occur during healing.\n\nLess common effects include infection, blistering, prolonged pigmentation changes, milia formation, or allergic reactions to topicals. Manual therapies risk bruising or temporary soreness.\n\nRare complications involve keloid/hypertrophic recurrence, permanent color/texture changes, nerve sensitivity loss, or poor wound healing. Risks increase with smoking, diabetes, active inflammation, or recent injury.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and that I fully understand it. This advice covers:\n\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits of the treatment\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and drawbacks, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed choice and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form and understand it completely. I have been given sufficient time for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that changes my decision to undergo treatment or to give my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document represents the complete disclosure and replaces any prior discussions or written information."
