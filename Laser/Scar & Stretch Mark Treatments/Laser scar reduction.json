                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form is designed to provide you with information about the possible advantages and risks associated with the laser scar reduction procedure. Please read this material thoroughly and have a comprehensive discussion with your skincare professional before proceeding.\n\nYou should take all the time necessary to carefully consider the treatment, evaluating all your options before arriving at an informed decision. It is crucial that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\nLaser scar reduction is a cosmetic treatment that uses focused laser energy to improve the appearance of scars from acne, surgery, injury, or burns by promoting collagen remodeling and skin resurfacing. Ablative lasers (like CO2 or Erbium) vaporize the top skin layer to smooth texture, while non-ablative lasers heat deeper layers to stimulate healing without surface damage. The procedure involves cleansing, numbing cream application, protective eyewear, and laser passes over scarred areas, typically lasting 30-90 minutes depending on scar size and type.\n\nYou may feel heat, stinging, or prickling during treatment. Downtime varies: ablative treatments cause 7-14 days of redness/peeling; non-ablative have minimal recovery. Multiple sessions (3-6), spaced 4-8 weeks apart, are usually needed, with gradual improvements over 3-12 months. Results vary by scar age, type, skin tone, and compliance; complete removal is not guaranteed.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for the best outcome. I will be informed before each session about the location and the practitioner who will be overseeing my care. I also understand that I will be updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nAfter the procedure, protect treated skin from sun, use prescribed ointments, cool compresses, and gentle care. Avoid picking, irritants, makeup, and heat sources until healed. Ablative treatments require 1-2 weeks recovery with redness/swelling; follow strict aftercare to prevent complications.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any medical or cosmetic procedure, there are associated risks. It is important you are aware of these and discuss them fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include redness, swelling, pain, itching, dryness, peeling, or darkening/lightening of skin, resolving over days to weeks. Ablative lasers cause longer recovery with oozing/crusting.\n\nLess common effects include infection, milia, prolonged swelling, blistering, acne flare-ups, or textural changes. Pigment alterations are more likely in darker skin or with sun exposure.\n\nRare complications include hypertrophic/keloid scarring, burns, eye injury, or permanent hypopigmentation/hyperpigmentation. Risks increase with smoking, poor healing, active skin disease, or isotretinoin use within 6-12 months.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and that I fully understand it. This advice covers:\n\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits of the treatment\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and drawbacks, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed choice and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form and understand it completely. I have been given sufficient time for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that changes my decision to undergo treatment or to give my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document represents the complete disclosure and replaces any prior discussions or written information."
