                        "disclaimer": "You should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion and you are encouraged to ask any questions that come to mind at any point during the process.\n\nReflexology is a therapeutic massage technique that involves applying pressure to specific points on the hands, feet, and sometimes other areas of the body. It is considered a complementary or alternative practice that some believe may assist with various health concerns. Reflexology is not a replacement for conventional medical care. Please consult your primary healthcare provider regarding any specific medical issues. It is suggested that reflexology may help reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and alleviate certain types of discomfort.\n\nReflexology is generally safe, non-invasive, and relaxing. There are no widely recognized serious risks or side effects. However, if you have circulatory disorders, diabetic foot complications, deep vein thrombosis, foot infections, foot ulcers, or any open wounds or injuries to your hands or feet, you should consult your doctor before proceeding. You should also seek medical advice prior to treatment if you are pregnant.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Following a reflexology session, some individuals may experience mild lightheadedness, emotional sensitivity, or slight tenderness in the hands or feet. These mild reactions typically last only a few hours at most.\n\nI confirm that I have been informed about all relevant aspects of this treatment and that I fully comprehend this advice. This includes information regarding:\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure itself\n- The risks associated with declining the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The anticipated benefits of the treatment\n- Potential drawbacks or disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the choice to have no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any follow-up care that might be necessary\n\nBy signing this document, I provide my consent to receive a Reflexology session. I understand that I may stop a session at any time. If a licensed healthcare professional has diagnosed me with any disease, injury, or other physical or mental condition, I understand that I should inform that professional about the session I will be receiving and whether I intend to discontinue any previously prescribed treatment or therapy. I acknowledge that by discontinuing any such medical treatment or therapy, I assume full responsibility for any negative consequences that may result from that decision.\n\nI have been asked what details I require to make an informed choice and have had the chance to discuss my desired outcome thoroughly.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent document and understand it completely. I have been provided sufficient opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has emerged that alters my decision to undergo the treatment or to provide my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document serves as the complete disclosure and replaces any prior verbal or written communications."
