                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form is designed to inform you about the possible advantages and drawbacks of the dermaplaning procedure. Please review this material thoroughly and have a complete conversation with your skincare specialist prior to undergoing the treatment.\n\nYou should take all the time necessary to thoughtfully consider the procedure, evaluating all available choices before making a well-informed decision. It is crucial to recognize your right to seek another professional opinion, and you are welcome to ask any questions at any point during the process.\n\nDermaplaning is a cosmetic skin procedure that employs a specialized blade to gently remove the topmost layer of skin, resulting in a smoother and more refreshed appearance. The treatment exfoliates dead skin cells and fine facial hair (often called peach fuzz). Potential benefits can include a diminished look of fine wrinkles and a temporary lightening of some discoloration. Like other exfoliating treatments, dermaplaning temporarily reduces the skin's natural barrier, which may improve the absorption and effectiveness of skincare products applied afterwards.\n\nI accept that there are no absolute promises regarding the outcome. I am aware that results can vary from person to person, and there is a possibility that the treatment may not work or the results may not meet my expectations. If results are unsatisfactory, I might need further sessions or a different type of skin treatment. Dermaplaning can typically be repeated every 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nI understand that multiple sessions might be needed to achieve the best results. I will be informed ahead of each appointment about where it will occur and which practitioner will be involved in my care. I will also be updated on my progress and retain the right to withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nI acknowledge that this procedure involves a mildly abrasive blade, and I agree to follow my skincare therapist's specific aftercare guidance.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: Although generally considered low-risk, dermaplaning, like any procedure, carries potential complications. It is important you know about these and discuss them fully with your practitioner.\n\nTypical reactions include minor skin tenderness and redness, which usually fade within a day. Some individuals might develop small, temporary blemishes a few days post-treatment.\n\nLess common risks include skin infections (like cellulitis) needing medical care, or permanent scarring. Another rare possibility is a change in skin color, becoming either lighter or darker. Such pigmentation changes often improve over six months but can sometimes be permanent.\n\nI confirm I have been advised about all pertinent information related to this treatment and that I comprehend it fully. This advice covers:\n\n• The reasons for and goals of the procedure\n• The general risks involved in the treatment\n• The risks of not having the procedure\n• Any risks specific to my personal situation\n• The expected advantages of the treatment\n• Potential drawbacks\n• Other available options and their advantages and disadvantages—including choosing no treatment\n• Any uncertainties and the probable success rate\n• Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I permit the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will be added to and stored within my confidential medical file.\n\nI have been asked what details I require to make an informed choice. I have had the chance to discuss my goals thoroughly to facilitate this decision.\n\nBy signing, I confirm I have read and fully comprehend the information in this document. My decision to proceed is based entirely on the details provided here. I have had all opportunities for discussion, and all my questions about dermaplaning have been answered. I therefore give my consent for the care or treatment described.\n\nAny issues must be raised with the practitioner within one month of treatment. I confirm I have read this consent, understand it completely, and have had plenty of time for discussion. All my queries have been answered satisfactorily. No new information has emerged that changes my decision to have the treatment or to give my consent. I hereby agree to this procedure. This document represents the complete disclosure and replaces any prior verbal or written explanations."
