                        "consentFormName": "Microneedling",
                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form is designed to provide you with information about the possible advantages and risks associated with the microneedling procedure. Please read this material thoroughly and have a comprehensive discussion with your skincare professional before proceeding.\n\nYou should take all the time necessary to carefully consider the treatment, evaluating all your options before arriving at an informed decision. It is crucial that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\nMicroneedling is a cosmetic skin treatment intended to refresh the skin and enhance its surface texture. It can help improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, enlarged pores, acne scars, discoloration, and stretch marks. During the procedure, a device containing fine needles creates multiple microscopic punctures in the skin's outer layer. This controlled, minor injury stimulates the skin's natural healing process, promoting new collagen production. The micro-channels also allow for better absorption of healing serums applied during treatment, aiming for overall skin renewal.\n\nA microneedling device is used to create numerous tiny punctures in the skin. A numbing cream is typically applied beforehand to increase comfort. A standard treatment includes the application of soothing gels and serums. If microneedling is combined with a PRP treatment (sometimes called a 'vampire facial'), the patient's own processed blood, rich in growth factors, is applied. The entire session usually takes between 30 and 60 minutes, depending on the area being treated.\n\nIt is likely that more than one session will be needed to achieve or maintain optimal results, though this depends on individual goals and skin response. Initial improvements may be noticeable after 2-3 weeks, with the best results typically visible around 4-6 weeks post-treatment. Results vary from person to person, and there is no guarantee of a specific outcome. Microneedling does not stop the original skin concern from potentially recurring in the future.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for the best outcome. I will be informed before each session about the location and the practitioner who will be overseeing my care. I also understand that I will be updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nAfter the procedure, you should limit the treated area's exposure to intense sun, UV lamps, and very cold weather until any initial redness or swelling has completely subsided.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any medical or cosmetic procedure, there are associated risks. It is important you are aware of these and discuss them fully with your practitioner.\n\nCommon side effects include discomfort or a stinging sensation during and after the treatment, which can be more pronounced over bony areas or where the skin is thinner. Immediately afterwards, the skin may feel tight, tender, swollen, and look red, similar to a sunburn. This sensitivity and redness usually lessen significantly within 24 hours and typically resolve completely within a week. Some individuals may feel faint or lightheaded during needle-based procedures; you must inform your practitioner immediately if you feel unwell.\n\nOther common temporary effects can include itching, minor pinpoint bleeding or bruising, scabbing, and temporary darkening of the treated area.\n\nLess common side effects include skin infection (cellulitis), reactivation of cold sores (herpes simplex), hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin), or hypopigmentation (lightening of the skin). Changes in skin color often fade within six months but can, in rare instances, be permanent. This risk is higher for individuals who tan easily or have darker skin tones and can be worsened by sun exposure. You can minimize this risk by avoiding sun exposure for four weeks before and after treatment, using a high-SPF sunscreen, and following all pre- and post-care instructions carefully.\n\nRare side effects include permanent skin scarring.\n\nI confirm I have been advised of all relevant information regarding this treatment and that I fully understand it. This advice covers:\n\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits of the treatment\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and drawbacks, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the likelihood of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed choice and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form and understand it completely. I have been given sufficient time for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that changes my decision to undergo treatment or to give my consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document represents the complete disclosure and replaces any prior discussions or written information."
