                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This document is intended to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of carbon laser treatment. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your practitioner before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the time you need to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your options before reaching an informed decision. It is essential that you are aware of your right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that arise at any stage of the process.\n\nA carbon laser facial is a treatment designed to rejuvenate the skin. It can address various concerns including dull or aging skin, pigmentation issues, acne, and enlarged pores. The procedure involves two steps: first, a carbon lotion is applied and then targeted with a laser to generate heat. This heat stimulates skin remodeling and collagen production, promoting rejuvenation. The second step uses the laser to remove the carbon lotion, which also has an exfoliating effect.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: A carbon laser peel is generally safe; however, there are some minor potential risks you should be aware of. You may experience mild discomfort during the treatment, such as a slight pinprick sensation or a warming feeling. These sensations are usually mild and well-tolerated.\n\nAfter the treatment, it is common to notice some redness and mild swelling, which should subside within two weeks. Rare side effects include blistering, hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin), infection, or scarring. If you experience any of these, you must contact your practitioner and may require medical evaluation.\n\nI confirm that I have been informed about all relevant aspects of this treatment and that I fully comprehend this advice. This includes information regarding:\n- The reasons for undergoing the procedure and the desired results\n- The inherent risks of the procedure itself\n- The risks associated with declining the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The anticipated benefits of the treatment\n- Potential drawbacks or disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the choice to have no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any follow-up care that might be necessary\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I require to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent, understand it fully, have had ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
