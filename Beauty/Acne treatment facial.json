                        "disclaimer": "PATIENT AGREEMENT: This form aims to inform you about the potential benefits and risks of an acne treatment facial. Please read this information carefully and discuss any questions fully with your provider before proceeding.\n\nYou should take the necessary time to consider this treatment thoroughly, weighing all your alternatives before making an informed decision. It is essential that you know you have the right to seek a second opinion, and you are encouraged to ask any questions that occur to you at any stage of the process.\n\nAn acne treatment facial is a specialized skincare procedure that includes deep cleansing, steaming, exfoliation, extractions, and the application of medicated masks or serums containing ingredients such as salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or sulfur to clear blocked pores, reduce swelling, eliminate acne-causing bacteria, and help prevent future breakouts. It targets active acne, blackheads, whiteheads, and skin congestion for a clearer complexion.\n\nThe session lasts 60-90 minutes, starting with double cleansing, followed by steaming to soften impurities, gentle exfoliation, manual or tool-assisted extractions, high-frequency or LED therapy, and calming masks. A course of 4-6 weekly sessions is often advised, with monthly maintenance thereafter. Due to factors such as skin type, acne severity, hormonal influences, and overall health, you acknowledge that there are no guarantees, warranties, or promises of satisfaction with your results.\n\nI understand that multiple appointments may be required for best results. I will be informed ahead of each session about the location and the identity of the practitioner involved in my care. I also understand I will be kept updated on my progress and that I may withdraw my consent at any time.\n\nRISKS AND POSSIBLE REACTIONS: As with any procedure, there are risks and potential complications. It is important that you are aware of these before proceeding. I am aware of the following potential risks/complications:\n\nCommon side effects include temporary redness, purging (initial flare-up of acne), dryness, flaking, or sensitivity from active ingredients, mild discomfort during extractions that subsides in 1-3 days. Increased sensitivity to sunlight requires consistent sunscreen use.\n\nRare complications include infection or scarring from overly forceful extractions, allergic reactions to products, irritation or chemical burns from acids/high-frequency, post-inflammatory dark spots (hyperpigmentation), or worsening of acne if not suitable for your skin type. Avoid if you have severe cystic acne, open sores, or are using retinoids.\n\nI understand that the treatment may involve risks of complication or injury from both known and unknown causes, and I voluntarily accept those risks. Before receiving treatment, I have been open in disclosing any condition that could affect this procedure.\n\nI confirm I have been provided with all relevant information regarding this treatment and fully understand it. This information includes details about:\n- My reasons for seeking treatment and the results I desire\n- The inherent risks of the procedure\n- The risks of not having the procedure\n- Any risks specific to my personal health\n- The expected benefits\n- Potential disadvantages\n- Alternative treatments and their advantages and disadvantages, including the option of no treatment\n- Any uncertainties and the probability of a successful outcome\n- Any necessary follow-up care\n\nMEDICAL IMAGERY: I authorize the taking of clinical photographs and videos. I understand these will become part of my confidential medical records.\n\nI have been asked what information I need to make an informed decision and have had the opportunity to discuss my goals in detail.\n\nI certify that I have read this consent form, understand it completely, have been given ample opportunity for discussion, and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. No new information has come to light that affects my decision to undergo treatment or provide consent. I hereby consent to this procedure. This document constitutes the complete and final disclosure and supersedes any prior verbal or written information."
